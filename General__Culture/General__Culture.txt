Its leaves look like flat-leaf parsley's, but note the smaller leaves and lankier stem. Cilantro's flavor is described by some as bright and citrusy, and as soapy by others. This herb pops up in the cuisines of India, Mexico, and Vietnam in dishes like dhania chutney, salsa, and pho. The seeds of the plant are called coriander and are used in some pickling recipes, as well as in&nbsp;<em>boerewors</em>, a South African sausage.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	
mint										"<!--anki--><img src=""Mint-leaves-2007.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""1280px-Mint_2014-06-01_00-53.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""20150813_095520.jpg"" />"								In the United States, the two most widely available varieties of mint  are peppermint and spearmint. The leaves of both plants look similar,  with their rough-fuzzy, jagged leaves, but they part ways when it comes  to their taste: Peppermint has a strong, cooling aftertaste due to the  high concentration of menthol; spearmint is lighter and sweeter to the  palate. Lesser-known types of mint include ginger, apple, and curly  mint, which, when used in large quantities, impart the flavor that is  connected to its name. Mint is a common ingredient in Thai food like rolls, as well as in Middle Eastern dishes such as tabbouleh, and in traditional mint tea  from North Africa. It's not unusual to see mint paired with lamb or  chocolate; other popular uses for the herb are jellies, sauces and  cocktails such as the Mint Julep and Mojito.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

Generally speaking, flat parsley has a peppery  bite whereas the curly kind is relatively bland. And as their names  denote, they have textural differences, too. Pastas and egg recipes  often benefit from a sprinkling of chopped parsley; the herb's clean,  light flavor cuts down on heavy creaminess and also acts as a  palate-cleanser.

Dill elicits strong reactions: Some  describe the flavor as clean and grassy, while others dislike it for  being tangy and earthy. And even though this herb is often associated  with Scandinavian cuisine (especially salmon)—gravlax, anyone?—it's found in other international dishes, as well: tzatziki (Greek), corn (Indian), and borscht (Eastern Europe). Often used in pickling, dill goes well with potatoes and dips that incorporate mayonnaise and sour cream.&nbsp;		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

The leaves of the purple basil tend to be smaller, and  while both kinds of basil share a similar flavor profile—peppery and  minty with a touch of sweetness—sweet basil is relatively sweeter than  its purple counterpart. Green basil is largely showcased in dishes from  Italy (basil pesto) and Southeast Asia (green chicken curry),  proving its versatility. The dark color of purple basil makes it a  wonderful garnish in dishes. Regardless of which kind you cook with, add  the leaves at the end of cooking for maximum flavor.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

Fresh oregano can be difficult to find in the marketplace and  because dried oregano has a stronger flavor than the fresh, use it  sparingly. Mediterranean (Greek) oregano is typically milder than  Mexican oregano, the former being used in pizza seasonings and the  latter sometimes called for in chili recipes.&nbsp;		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs
rosemary										"<img src=""rosemary.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""Rosemary_bush.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""Rosemary-shrub-4-10-2010-4-55-41-PM.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""RosemaryWhole.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""Rosemary2.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""large_square_Rosemary_Needles__Cracked__close.jpg"" />"					Rosemary has a strong, even pungent, pinelike fragrance and flavor.  Recipes that call for rosemary tend to require the needles to be  stripped off their branches and chopped before cooking. But don't  overlook the woody stems, which can be used to flavor soups and roasts.  Native to the Mediterranean region, rosemary gained popularity with  Italian cooking in Tuscan favorites like schiacciata, a flatbread that  is sometimes made savory with rosemary-infused oil, and chicken cacciatore. The herb pairs well with pork chops, poultry, and even fish, (especially when grilled). Vegetarians can enjoy the herb in potatoes. For an unusual sweet-savory treat, consider rosemary shortbread cookies.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

Its deep-green hollow stems lend a refreshingly light oniony  taste, which helps cut down on the heaviness of rich foods such as blue cheese and chive dressing and risotto cakes. When finely chopped, chives work well as a garnish.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs
sage										"<img src=""sage-hanging.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""herb-sage-organic-dried-herb-salvia-officinalis-1.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""il_fullxfull.617679104_i943.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""Clary-Sage.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""RED_SAGE_DRIED_HERB.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""sage-dried-uk.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""sage.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""RX-DK-FVP13904_sage-plant_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.1280.960.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""sage-planting-growing-harvesting.jpg"" />"		This plant's light gray-green leaves are soft and fuzzy, and its taste  ranges from mild to slightly peppery with some touches of mint. Because  of its pronounced flavoring, sage is a good herb to pair with foods  traditionally considered heavy, rich, and creamy, like meats (sausage), and certain dairy products such as cheese and cream (ravioli with sage cream sauce), as well as sweet and savory breads (cornbread). Unlike more delicate herbs, sage can be added in the beginning of the cooking process.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

In general, savory has a peppery flavor, although winter  savory is more pungent and stronger flavored than the summer variety.  This herb has long been incorporated into European cuisines such as beans,meat, and poultry. It is also commonly added to soups and stews that have meat or poultry and/or beans, as in this Georgian Pork stew and white bean and pasta soup.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

Thyme is a  major ingredient in the classic French flavoring herbes de Provence. And  it plays a major role, next to parsley and bay leaf, in another blend  of French herbs, bouquet garni, a crucial flavor component in broths,  soups, and stews. Thyme's importance in Middle Eastern cooking cannot be  understated; along with oregano and marjoram, it is a crucial element  in zaatar.  This herbal blend is often used in flatbreads such as pita, as well as  to flavor roasted meat and poultry. Like rosemary, recipes calling for  thyme require you to strip the leaves off the woody stems. Using the  entire herb infuses a headier scent and flavor.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

The herb is  often paired with foods that easily absorb other flavors such as chicken, scallops, and eggs.  Once considered the king of herbs in French cuisine, tarragon is an  essential ingredient in the classic béarnaise sauce. It's not an easy  herb to keep for long periods of time so it is often placed in a bottle  of vinegar. Elegant in form, the herb also makes for an elegant garnish.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs

Like thyme, marjoram works well in ensembles (herbes  de Provence and zaatar)  and pairs nicely with meats and poultry, especially in stews. In  Mexico, marjoram, thyme, and oregano are combined to create a lively  pungent <em>hierbas de olor</em>, the Mexican equivalent to the French  bouquet garni. Try also using marjoram in tomato sauce, white bean  salads, fish dishes and vinaigrettes.		http://www.epicurious.com/archive/seasonalcooking/farmtotable/visualguidefreshherbs	herbs
uramaki										"The ""Inside-Out"" Maki Roll Rice on the Outside, Nori on the Inside"										"The story goes that it was developed in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles in the late 1960's by Machita Ichiro the sushi chef in a restaurant called Tokyo Kaikan.<div><br /></div><div>It seems the restaurant was having problems obtaining fat belly tuna (toro) for its mainly Japanese customers so started to substitute avocado instead.

This seemed to pacify the American customers and so the California Roll was born.</div><div><br /></div><div>Rather clever, don't you think?</div><div><br /></div><div>It must have worked because Uramaki seems to be one of the most popular types of sushi now in the U.S.  Its popularity however has not been duplicated in Japan.

abura bouzu	abura sokomutsu									this is escolar (oilfish) and sometimes called shiro maguro, although it is not tuna and should not be confused with that fish. bright white in color and quite fatty, this fish is not always easy to find. due to the high levels of fatty esters, this particular fish may cause digestive issues with some individuals, and for that reason has been prohibited in japan since the 1970′s. if your body can tolerate it, the creamy texture and clean taste can be quite appealing.	Escolar, Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, is a fish found in tropical and temperate waters around the world. It is also known as snake mackerel, and is sometimes fraudulently marketed as “butterfish” or “white tuna,” a controversial practice due to potential health problems related with consumption of the fish. It has a high wax ester that can can cause keriorrhea, a condition similar to diarrhea, only the body will expel yellowish-orange drops of oil (the ester from the fish). Headaches and stomach cramps can accompany the keriorrhea. Portions of six ounces or less seem to limit the negative effects, so a few pieces of mislabeled escolar at the sushi bar may not be harmful.

Traditionally, an onigiri is filled with pickled ume (umeboshi), salted salmon, katsuobushi, kombu, tarako, or any other salty or sour ingredient as a natural preservative. Because of the popularity of onigiri in Japan, most convenience stores stock their onigiri with various fillings and flavors. There are even specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide.		http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/fish/seafood/sushi-glossary2.asp	sushi

tsukudani										"<img src=""tsukudani-230r.jpg"" />"										Neither sushi nor sashimi, tsukudani refers to small fish or other food (pieces of meat or seaweed) cooked in a soy sauce, mirin (rice wine) and sugar blend and served as a side dish. This technique originated as a method to preserve fish in the Edo Period when the shoguns ruled, from 1603 to 1868. The name is taken from the Tsukudajima, a fishing village in the middle of Tokyo (today surrounded by skyscrapers) where it was first made in the Edo period. The sweet and salty taste of tsukudani pairs perfectly with rice, and has become a popular dish in Japanese homes. People from outside the country find the taste similar to teriyaki and often refer to it as “teriyaki fish.” The difference is that tsukudani is boiled until the food is very soft. With sardines, for example, the bones become soft enough to eat.		http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/fish/seafood/sushi-glossary8.asp	sushi
parsnip	<i>Pastinaca sativa</i>									"<img src=""Parsnip-Illustration-jpg.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""parsnip-turga_LRG.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""PastinakePflanzegeerntet.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""baked-parsnip-fries-with-rosemary-646.jpg"" />"	"<img src=""parsnip-nutrition-facts.jpg"" />"						<p>The <b>parsnip</b> (<i>Pastinaca sativa</i>) is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual.  Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in  the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts.  In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel  of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time,  the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown,  flat, and winged.</p> <p>The parsnip is native to Eurasia.  It has been used as a vegetable since antiquity and was cultivated by  the Romans, although some confusion exists in the literature of the time  between parsnips and carrots. It was used as a sweetener before the arrival in Europe of cane sugar. It was introduced into the United States in the 19th century.</p> <p>The parsnip is usually cooked, but can also be eaten raw. It is high in vitamins and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.</p>
