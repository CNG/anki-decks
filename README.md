# Anki decks

Some of my Anki decks are here, mostly for version control. I have not yet found the time and strategy to curate them for public consumption. They contain a combination of decks downloaded from Anki's shared decks catalog, some of which I have modified, and decks I created myself, most of which are not cohesive or exhaustive but rather reflect my use of Anki in lieu of jotting down things I want to remember.
