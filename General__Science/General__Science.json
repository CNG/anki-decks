Its effects are often compared to those produced by entheogenic tryptamines like psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. It is typically taken orally, less commonly via insufflation and rarely, via injection.\n\nThis compound has been proposed by psychedelics researcher David Nichols to be a potentially useful alternative to psilocybin for pharmacological research as they are both believed to act as prodrugs for psilocin (4-HO-DMT), the primary active component of psilocybin mushrooms. Its structural similarities to psilocin and psilocybin are thought to account for the near identical effects they produce and the three compounds are often considered to be interchangeable with each other.\n\nAdditionally, it is widely believed to have a similar if not near-identical toxicity profile as psilocybin itself, which makes it unusually physically benign and toxicologically predictable for a research chemical.\n\n4-AcO-DMT and several other esters of psilocin were originally patented on January 16, 1963 by Sandoz Ltd. via Albert Hofmann & Franz Troxler. Despite this, 4-AcO-DMT has a limited history of use prior to its release as a grey area compound on the online research chemical market, where it has over time gained a sizable cult following due to its reputation for producing classical entheogenic effects despite being a purely synthetic substance in origin.\n\nAfter being exclusively distributed on the online grey-market for many years, 4-AcO-DMT has recently been documented being sold as \"shroom pills\" on the street (either in the form of pressed tablets or gel capsules).",

Tryptamines share a core structure comprising a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to a terminal amino group via an ethyl side chain.\n\n4-AcO-DMT is substituted at R4 of its indole heterocycle with an acetoxy (-AcO) functional group CH3COO−. It also contains two methyl groups CH3- bound to the terminal amine RN of the ethyl side chain, meaning it contains the DMT molecule as its molecular backbone.\n\nStructurally, 4-AcO-DMT is the acetate ester analog of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) and the N-substituted methyl homolog of 4-AcO-MET. It can be considered to be the O-acetylated form of psilocin, whereas psilocybin is the O-phosphorylated form.",

                        "Pharmacodynamics\n\n4-AcO-DMT's psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience has yet to be elucidated.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nIn the body, 4-AcO-DMT is thought to be deacetylated into psilocin during first pass metabolism, by the acidic conditions in the stomach, and it subsequently passes through the liver (this is made evident by the fact that 4-AcO-DMT is also active when injected). This has not been formally proven, however, and is based on reports that most users cannot identify the difference between these two compounds when ingested to the point that they are often considered as indistinguishable from each other in terms of their subjective effects.\n\nThere are, however, claims of subjective differences in effect between the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of psilocin. Some users report that 4-AcO-DMT lasts slightly longer than psilocin while others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time. Many users report less body load and nausea compared to psilocin. Some users find that the visual distortions produced by 4-AcO-DMT more closely resemble those produced by DMT than those produced by psilocybin mushrooms. These differences, if substantiated, may be due to unique effects produced by 4-AcO-DMT itself prior to deacetylation, to different pharmacokinetics (i.e. different rates of absorption and distribution), or both.",

                        "Cannabis - When used in conjunction with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of 4-AcO-DMT can be intensified and extended with extreme efficiency. This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and psychotomimetic producing aspects of cannabis significantly. The THC and psilocybin synergy is unique in that the severity of its mind-altering qualities can greatly depend on when during the experience the cannabis is taken, as 4-AcO-DMT experiences are often considered to have less of a predictable continuity than many other commonly used psychedelics.\n    Dissociatives - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of psilocybin can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, along with more intense internal hallucinations, confusion, nausea, delusions and chances of a psychotic reaction.\n    MDMA - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of the 4-AcO-DMT are also intensified, sometimes to the point of overwhelming euphoric bliss manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, as well as fantastic colorful, intricate and majestic visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. It should be noted that the potential toxic effects of this combination are, however, unknown.\n    Alcohol - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause dehydration, nausea, and physical fatigue which can negatively affect the experience if taken in moderate to high dosages. This combination is, however, considered to be reasonably safe in low doses and when used responsibly, this can often take the edge off the experience as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit on a more stressful manner on the body.\n    Benzodiazepines - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a 4-AcO-DMT experience. They can be very efficient at largely stopping or mitigating a bad trip at the cost of amnesia and reduced intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the very high addiction potential associated with benzodiazepines.\n    Psychedelics - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason, generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.",

The causes are poorly understood, but it may be due to its glutaminergic and GABAergic properties.\n    Stimulants - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable anxiety, panic, thought loops and paranoia.

It is the parent compound of the substituted amphetamines class which also includes MDMA, methamphetamine, DOM and many others.\n\nAmphetamine is widely used throughout the world as a prescription medicine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the sleeping disorder narcolepsy. It is also used without prescription as an illicit substance of recreational use or abuse.\n\nAlthough the term amphetamine traditionally refers to an equal combination of the two enantiomers levoamphetamine (l-amphetamine) and dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine), it is frequently used for any mixture of the two or only one of them.

                        "Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Neither drug had a pharmacological use until 1934, when Smith, Kline and French began selling amphetamine as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant.\n\nDuring World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. Eventually, as the addictive properties of the drugs became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of the drugs. For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nDespite strict government controls, both amphetamine and methamphetamine have still been used legally or illicitly by individuals from a variety of backgrounds for different purposes.\n\nDue to the large underground market for these drugs, they are frequently illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold on the black market. Based upon drug and drug precursor seizures, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine.",

Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to arise from typical medical use.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of amphetamine develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. Upon single administration, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Stimulants - Amphetamine can be potentially dangerous in combination with other stimulants as it can increase one's heart rate and blood pressure to dangerous levels.\n    Tricyclic antidepressants - Amphetamine may increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressants to dangerous levels.\n    25x-NBOMe - Both the NBOMe series and this compound induce powerful stimulation and their interaction may cause severe side effects. These can include thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heart failure (in extreme cases).\n    Alcohol - It is dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    DXM - This combination may cause increased heart rate and panic attacks.\n    MXE - Increased heart rate and blood pressure may occur.\n    Tramadol - This combination can increase the risk of seizures.\n    MDMA - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with amphetamines.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants.\n    Cocaine - This combination may increase strain on the heart.",

It is commonly used to enhance cognition, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness.\n\nModafinil is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, shift work sleep disorder and narcolepsy. However, studies have shown that modafinil may also be useful off-label for alleviating the symptoms of depression,, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, seasonal depressive disorder, ADHD,and various other conditions which have fatigue as a symptom.\n\nModafinil has also been used as a doping agent by various athletes due to its ability to produce physical stimulation. It has recently gained mainstream popularity for its use as a \"smart drug\" to improve memory, counteract the desire or need for sleep, and increase general productivity.",

From this sulphur group at R2, an acetamide group is bound at its free carbon through a carbonyl group to a terminal amine group. Modafinil is structurally analogous to fluorafinil, another benzhydryl stimulant.\n\nWhile modafinil is a racemic mixture, a similar medication, armodafinil, consists of only the (−)-(R)-enantiomer of modafinil.",

                        "Although the exact mechanisms by which modafinil and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil, decrease sleepiness are not fully understood, evidence suggests that these agents promote wakefulness by acting directly or indirectly on many components of the sleep / wake circuit. Modafinil and armodafinil are hypothesized to inhibit GABA and promote dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, and hypocretin / orexin.\n\nModafinil and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil, increase both norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), possibly via their blockade of both the NE and DA reuptake transporters (NET and DAT, respectively). The actions of NE at alpha-adrenergic receptors and DA at dopamine D2 receptors are thought to contribute to the wake-promoting properties of modafinil. Orexin is a key component of the arousal system; thus, the hypothesized action of modafinil on the orexinergic system may help increase alertness. Additionally, modafinil may indirectly increase histamine, either by reducing GABAergic inhibition of histaminergic neurons or via actions at orexinergic neurons. The increase in histamine may contribute to both the wake-promoting effects of modafinil as well as the potential of modafinil to increase alertness.\n\nIn genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not reduced by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats. In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, blocks the action of amphetamine but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.",

The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    25x-NBOMe - Both the NBOMe series and this compound induce powerful stimulation and their interaction may cause severe side effects. These can include thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heart failure (in extreme cases).\n    Alcohol - It is dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    DXM - This combination may cause increased heart rate and panic attacks.\n    MXE - Increased heart rate and blood pressure may occur.\n    Tramadol - This combination can increase the risk of seizures.\n    MDMA - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels.

It contains a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (-NH2) group through an ethyl chain. It is structurally similar to amphetamine, featuring a substitution at Rα which is incorporated into a piperidine ring ending at the terminal amine of the phenethylamine chain. Additionally, it contains a methyl acetate bound to R2 or its structure. Methylphenidate is structurally different to ethylphenidate by the length of the carbon chain on their acetate group. Methyl- regards the side chain of one carbon atom, phen- indicates the phenyl ring, id- is contracted from a piperidine ring, and -ate indicates the acetate group containing the oxygens. Methylphenidate is a chiral compound, presumably produced as a racemic mixture. It has an enantiopure also sold as a pharmaceutical; the dextrorotary enantiopure is known as \"dexmethylphenidate\" and is commonly sold as Focalin and Focalin XR.",

Methylphenidate binds to and blocks dopamine transporters and norepinephrine transporters.\n\nWhile both amphetamine and methylphenidate are dopaminergic, it should be noted that their methods of action are somewhat distinct. Specifically, methylphenidate is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Each of these drugs have a corresponding effect on norepinephrine which are weaker than their effects on dopamine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action at dopamine-norepinephrine release is still debated, but is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives as methylphenidate is thought to increase general firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate and reverses the flow of the monoamines via TAAR1 activation.",

                        "In terms of its tolerance, methylphenidate can be used multiple days in a row for extended periods of time and is often prescribed to be used in this way. Tolerance to many of the effects of methyphenidate develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. In the case of acute (i.e. one-off) exposure, it generally takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methylphenidate presents cross-tolerance with all dopaminergic stimulants, meaning that after the consumption of methyphenidate all stimulants will have a reduced effect.\"\n\nAs with other stimulants, the chronic use of methylphenidate can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. Methylphenidate has some potential for abuse due to its action on dopamine transporters. Methylphenidate, like other stimulants, increases dopamine levels in the brain. However, at therapeutic doses this increase is slow and thus euphoria only rarely occurs even when it is administered intravenously. The abuse and addiction potential of methylphenidate is therefore significantly lower than other dopaminergic stimulants.\n\nThe abuse potential is increased when methylphenidate is crushed and insufflated (snorted) or injected.. It should be noted that due to the fillers in the pill, however, that this can be harmful to the nasal cavities. The primary source of methylphenidate for abuse is the diversion from legitimate prescriptions rather than illicit synthesis. Those who use methylphenidate medicinally generally take it orally as instructed while intranasal and intravenous are the preferred means for recreational use.",

Psychotic symptoms from methylphenidate can include hearing voices, visual hallucinations, urges to harm oneself, severe anxiety, mania, disinhibition, paranoid and grandiose delusions, confusion, emotional suppression, increased aggression, and irritability.",

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    25x-NBOMe - Both the NBOMe series and this compound induce powerful stimulation and their interaction may cause severe side effects. These can include thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heart failure (in extreme cases).\n    Alcohol - It is dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    DXM - This combination may cause increased heart rate and panic attacks.\n    MXE - Increased heart rate and blood pressure may occur.\n    Tramadol - This combination can increase the risk of seizures.\n    MDMA - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants.\n    Cocaine - This combination may increase strain on the heart.",

Norepinephrine release causes increased alertness and arousal. With low doses, nicotine enhances the action of norepinephrine and dopamine, which produces typical psychostimulation.

                        "Nicotine activates the reward system (mesolimbic pathway) of the brain, which is responsible for its addictive nature. Because of this, tobacco smoking is extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse. It is considered to be as addictive as cocaine or heroin. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nChronic use of nicotine, as with many other addictive substances, downregulates the production of dopamine and other stimulatory neurotransmitters and also desensitizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In response, the brain upregulates the number of receptors presented. The net effect is an increase in sensitivity to the reward system; the opposite of the decrease in sensitivity as caused by addictive substances like cocaine and heroin.\n\nTolerance to the effects of this compound rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Nicotine does not present a cross-tolerance with other dopaminergic stimulants, meaning that after the use of nicotine all stimulants will not have a reduced effect.\n\nFollowing discontinuation of nicotine, receptors may take several months to return to baseline.",

It has found widespread use in modern society for its ability to increase activity in the brain and induces temporary improvements including enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion.\n\nCaffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators. It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush, as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut.\n\nUnlike many other psychoactive drugs, this substance is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity. Caffeine is the most commonly used drug in the world, with 90% of adults in North America consuming it on a daily basis. Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. This amounts to one serving of a caffeinated beverage for every person every day.",

                        "Caffeine acts through several mechanisms, but its most important effect is to counteract a substance called adenosine that naturally circulates at high levels throughout the body, and especially in the nervous system. In the brain, adenosine plays a generally protective role, part of which is to reduce neural activity levels.\n\nThe principal mechanism of action of caffeine is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors. The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is thus capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive inhibitor.\n\nAlongside this, caffeine also has profound effects on most of the other major neurotransmitters, including dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and, in high doses, on norepinephrine, and to a small extent epinephrine, glutamate, and cortisol. At high doses, exceeding 500 milligrams, caffeine inhibits GABA neurotransmission. GABA reduction explains why caffeine increases anxiety, insomnia, rapid heart and respiration rate at high dosages.\n710px-Caffeine metabolites.svg.png\nMetabolites\n\nCaffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system, in particular, by the CYP1A2 isozyme, into three dimethylxanthines, each of which has its own effects on the body:\n\n    Paraxanthine (84%): Increases lipolysis, leading to elevated glycerol and free fatty acid levels in the blood plasma.\n    Theobromine (12%): Dilates blood vessels and increases urine volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in the cocoa bean, and therefore chocolate.\n    Theophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchi, and is used to treat asthma. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism.",

                        "N-Methylamphetamine (also known as Methamphetamine, Meth, Glass, Ice, Shard, Crank, Tina, Tweak, Yaba, and Crystal) is a highly potent, widely-used synthetic stimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes that produces powerful and long-lived classical stimulant effects such as stimulation, wakefulness, disinhibition, thought acceleration, and intense states of euphoria when administered.\n\nMethamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under the trade name \"Desoxyn\". However, it is rarely prescribed due to its abuse potential, typically being reserved for cases of severe obesity or ADHD in which all other treatment options have been exhausted.\n\nRecreationally, methamphetamine is used to lift the mood, increase energy, and increase sexual desire. In low doses, methamphetamine can produce an elevated mood and increased immersion, increased focus, and physical stamina in fatigued individuals. At heavier doses, it can induce states of anxiety & paranoia, delusions, thought disorganization and psychosis, in addition to severe physical injuries such as rhabdomyolysis (kidney damage) and cerebral hemorrhage. It is associated with compulsive redosing, especially when it is vaporized (\"smoked\") or injected, due to the initial overwhelming euphoric rush it can produce.\n\nUnlike amphetamine at therapeutic doses, methamphetamine at moderate to heavy recreational doses is considered to be directly neurotoxic to humans, damaging both dopamine and serotonin neurons within the central nervous system that are essential in maintaining the proper processing and integration of sensory information, its integration and controlling motor and behavioral output. Additionally, there is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long-term use in humans; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity.\n\nDue to its potent psychostimulant effects, established toxicity profile, and ability to cause mental and physical dependence and addiction when misused, it is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if choosing to consume this substance.",

                        "Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Neither drug had a pharmacological use until 1934, when Smith, Kline and French began selling amphetamine as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant.\n\nDuring World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. Eventually, as the addictive properties of the drugs became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of the drugs. For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nDespite strict government controls, both amphetamine and methamphetamine have still been used legally or illicitly by individuals from a variety of backgrounds for different purposes.\n\nDue to the large underground market for these drugs, they are frequently illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold on the black market. Based upon drug and drug precursor seizures, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine.",

Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at Rα. Amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. Methamphetamine contains an additional methyl substitution at RN, a substitution which is shared with MDMA, methcathinone, and mephedrone.\nStereoisomers\n\nMethamphetamine exists as two enantiomers: dextrorotary and levorotary. Dextrorotatory or dextromethamphetamine (also known as d-methamphetamine) is a stronger central nervous system (CNS) stimulant than levomethamphetamine; however, both are considered to be dependence-forming and addictive when misused and capable of producing similar toxicity symptoms at heavy recreational doses.",

It also acts as a reuptake inhibitor, increasing levels of monoamines by forcing the neurotransmitters out of their storage vesicles and expelling them into the synaptic gap by making the dopamine transporters work in reverse. Other mechanisms by which methamphetamine are known to increase monoamine levels are by:\n\n    Blocking the reuptake of monoamines (i.e. norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) by inhibiting the activity of their transporters, allowing them to accumulate in the synaptic cleft between neurons in various brain regions.\n    Decreasing the expression of dopamine transporters at the cell surface, which has the same effect as listed above.\n    Increasing cytosolic levels of monoamines by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO)\n    Increasing the activity and expression of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)\n\nIn addition to releasing potent amounts of monoamines, MA has a high lipid solubility which leads to a relatively fast transfer of the drug across the blood-brain barrier and a quick onset in comparison to other stimulants. All of this results in feelings of reward, euphoria, and stimulation as well as an unpleasant offset.",

Similar to the neurotoxic effects on the dopamine system, methamphetamine can also result in neurotoxicity to serotonin neurons.

                        "As with other stimulants, the chronic use of methamphetamine can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to the effects of this compound rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methamphetamine presents cross-tolerance with all dopaminergic stimulants, meaning that after the consumption of methamphetamine all stimulants will have a reduced effect.\n\nThe evidence on effective treatments for amphetamine and methamphetamine dependence and abuse is limited. In light of this, fluoxetine and imipramine appear to have some limited benefits in treating abuse and addiction, \"no treatment has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence and abuse\".\n\nIn highly dependent amphetamine and methamphetamine abusers, \"when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue methamphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose\". Withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in up to 87.6% of cases, and persist for three to four weeks with a marked \"crash\" phase occurring during the first week. Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and vivid or lucid dreams. Withdrawal symptoms are associated with the degree of dependence (i.e., the extent of abuse).

These can include thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heart failure (in extreme cases).\n    Alcohol - It is dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    DXM - This combination may cause increased heart rate and panic attacks.\n    MXE - Increased heart rate and blood pressure may occur.\n    Tramadol - This combination can increase the risk of seizures.\n    MDMA - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with amphetamines.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels.

                        "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (also known as Ecstasy, XTC, MDMA, MD, Molly, and Mandy, among others) is a widely-used synthetic entactogenic substance of the amphetamine and phenethylamine chemical classes. It produces prototypical entactogenic effects such as anxiety relief, disinhibition, enhanced feelings of empathy, affection, and sociability, muscle relaxation, stimulation, and euphoria when administered.\n\nMDMA was originally synthesized in 1912 for its potential anti-bleeding properties but was largely forgotten about for the following 65 years. The first reports of its recreational usage did not appear until 1970. Psychedelic chemist and researcher Alexander Shulgin is credited with introducing and popularizing the use of MDMA in underground psychotherapeutic circles in the late 1970s. It became a controlled substance in 1985 when its use began to propagate out into the mainstream night-life and rave culture.\n\nSince the 1980s, MDMA has become widely known as \"Ecstasy\" (shortened to \"E\", \"X\", or \"XTC\"), usually referring to its street forms as illicitly pressed pills or tablets. The American term \"Molly\" and the British equivalent term \"Mandy\" originally referred to crystal or powder MDMA that was purported to be of high purity and free of adulteration. However, it has since evolved into a generic street term for any number of euphoric stimulants that are sold in powder or crystal form.\n\nDespite MDMA being illegal in most, if not all countries, its use remains widespread. In 2014, MDMA was estimated to be one of the most popular recreational drugs used in the world, alongside cocaine and cannabis. It has become associated with a number of contemporary youth and alternative subcultures.\n\nToday, researchers are investigating whether controlled doses of MDMA may be useful in psychotherapy as an aid in treating a number of psychiatric conditions such as severe, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety in autistic adults, and anxiety in those with life-threatening illness. More research is needed, however, to determine if its potential benefits outweighs the risk of its possible harms.",

                        "MDMA was originally synthesized by Anton Köllisch, a chemist then employed by the Merck company. Köllisch was interested in developing substances that would help manage excess bleeding and was interested in the activity of MDMA, an intermediary in the production of hydrastinine, a hemostatic agent used at the time. In 1965, Alexander Shulgin synthesized MDMA while conducting experiments with methylenedioxy-substituted compounds but did not test the psychoactivity of the compound.\n\nAround 1975, Shulgin heard about the effects of MDMA from a student. After hearing several more stories about the self-administration of MDMA, he decided to experiment with it. Shulgin was impressed with the effects of the substance and thought it could have useful therapeutic applications. Shulgin advertised the substance to therapists and psychiatrists for medical use, and it eventually became quite popular in the medical world for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders.\n\nDuring this time the Californian psychotherapist Dr. Leo Zeff, who had worked with LSD psychotherapy in the 1960s, came out of retirement and subsequently introduced the then-legal MDMA to over 4,000 patients. Then known as \"Adam\", from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s there was a growth of clinicians using MDMA around California.\n\nThe recreational use of MDMA became popular at around the same time, particularly in nightclubs, and eventually caught the attention of the Drug Enforcement Administration. After several hearings, a US Federal Administrative Law Judge recommended that MDMA should be made a Schedule III controlled substance so that it could be used in the medical field. Despite this, the director of the DEA overruled this and classified MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance.\n\nIn the UK, the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, which had already been altered in 1977 to include all ring-substituted amphetamines like MDMA, was further amended in 1985 to refer specifically to Ecstasy, placing it in the Class A category.",

In addition to this, MDMA contains a methyl substitution on RN, a feature it shares with methamphetamine. Critically, the MDMA molecule also contains substitutions at R3 and R4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups -- these oxygen groups are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene bridge.

                        "Neurotoxicity\n\nThe neurotoxicity of MDMA use has long been the subject of debate. Scientific study has resulted in the general agreement that, although it is physically safe to try in a responsible context, the administration of repeated or high dosages of MDMA is most certainly neurotoxic in some form.\n\nAdministration of MDMA causes subsequent down-regulation of serotonin reuptake transporters in the brain. The rate at which the brain recovers from serotonergic changes is unclear. One study demonstrated lasting serotonergic changes in some animals exposed to MDMA. Other studies have suggested that the brain may recover from serotonergic damage.\n\nIt is thought that MDMA's metabolites play a large role in the in the uncertain levels of neurotoxicity. For example, a metabolite of MDMA called alpha-MethylDopamine (which is known to be toxic to dopamine neurons) was thought believed to be involved in the toxicity of MDMA to serotonin receptors. However, one study found this to not be the case as direct administration of aMD did not cause neurotoxicity. Additionally, MDMA injected directly into the brain was found to not be toxic, implying a metabolite is responsible for the toxicity when MDMA is administered via insufflation or oral consumption.\n\nThis study found that although aMD is involved, it is a further metabolite of aMD involving glutathione that is primarily responsible for the selective damage to 5-HT receptors triggered by MDMA/MDA.This metabolite forms in higher concentrations when core temperature is elevated. It is taken up into serotonin receptors by its transporters and metabolized by MAO-B into a reactive oxygen species which can cause neurological damage.\nCardiotoxicity\n\nLong-term heavy use of MDMA has been shown to be cardiotoxic and may lead to valvulopathy (heart valve damage) through its actions on the 5-HT2B receptor. In one study, 28% of long-term users (2-3 doses per week for a mean of 6 years, mean of age 24.3 years) had developed clinically evident valvular heart disease.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.",

Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    25x-NBOMe - Both the NBOMe series and this compound induce powerful stimulation and their interaction may cause severe side effects. These can include thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heart failure (in extreme cases).\n    Alcohol - It is dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    DXM - This combination may cause increased heart rate and panic attacks.\n    MXE - Increased heart rate and blood pressure may occur.\n    Tramadol - This combination can increase the risk of seizures.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants.\n    Stimulants - The neurotoxic and cardiotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.\n    Cocaine - This combination may increase strain on the heart to dangerous levels.\n\nSerotonin syndrome risk\n\nCombinations in the list below may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels.\n\n    MAOIs such as syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants\n    Serotonin releasers such as MDMA, 4-FA, MDAI and αMT\n    Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n    Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n    5-HTP",

It produces classical stimulant effects such as stimulation, disinhibition, thought acceleration, and euphoria when administered.\n\nThe name comes from \"coca\" and the alkaloid suffix \"-ine\", forming \"cocaine\". This substance has notably short-lived effects and is classed as a stimulant, an appetite suppressant and a local anaesthetic. It is thought to be markedly more dangerous than other CNS stimulants, including the entire amphetamine drug class. Regular use has been linked to the development of permanent heart conditions and at high doses it can cause sudden cardiac death.\n\nAccording to a 2007 United Nations report, cocaine is the second most widely used illicit substance in the world behind cannabis. In terms of user rates, Spain is the country with the highest rate of cocaine usage (3.0% of adults in the previous year). Other countries where the usage rate meets or exceeds 1.5% are the United States (2.8%), England and Wales (2.4%), Canada (2.3%), Italy (2.1%), Bolivia (1.9%), Chile (1.8%), and Scotland (1.5%).",

It is most commonly consumed as the hydrochloride salt which is typically produced in clandestine laboratories. Cocaine decomposes when heated strongly so the freebase and hydrogen carbonate salts of cocaine, which have much lower boiling points compared to the hydrochloride salt, are typically used when the substance is to be vaporized and are known as cocaine base and crack respectively.\n\nThe chemical structure of cocaine consists of three parts; the hydrophilic methyl ester moiety and the lipophilic benzoyl ester moiety, which are located in place of the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups of ecgonine respectively. This structure allows for its rapid absorption through nasal membranes and blood-brain barrier. Cocaine can be produced synthetically but the complexity of tropane synthesis and the sophisticated equipment required compared to the relative ease of growing coca plants prevent synthesis being economically viable.\n\nThe presence of the two ester groups makes cocaine relatively unstable in warm, humid environments and cocaine stored in an open container or with a high moisture content will lose apparent potency over time due to hydrolysis to methyl ecgonine or benzoylecgonine.\n\nCocaine is structurally similar to atropine and scopolamine, which also contain the tropane moiety.",

                        "The most extensively studied effect of cocaine on the central nervous system is the blockade of the dopamine transporter protein's function. This substance acts as a reuptake inhibitor and prevents dopamine from being recycled, causing excessive amounts to build up in the synapse, or junction between neurons. The result is an enhanced and prolonged post-synaptic effect of dopaminergic signaling at dopamine receptors on the receiving neuron. To a lesser extent, cocaine also exhibits functionally similar effects of reuptake inhibition upon the neurotransmitters of serotonin and noradrenaline. It is this sudden flood of neurotransmitters that causes cocaine’s characteristic high.\n\nCocaine is often adulterated when sold on black markets and this can significantly alter its effects on the body. Even when adulterants are pharmacologically inactive, their combination with the long-term perishability of cocaine due to moisture can lead to vastly differing apparent potencies between dosages of cocaine, and as such, it can be challenging to determine a \"typical\" recreational dose. Pure cocaine is very potent and generates perceptible local anesthetic effects from 1 mg and perceptible CNS stimulation from 5-7 mg, however in recreational settings much higher doses tend to be preferred.",

                        "Salts: Cocaine is a weakly alkaline compound (an \"alkaloid\") and can, therefore, combine with acidic compounds to form various salts. The hydrochloride (HCl) salt of cocaine is by far the most commonly encountered, although the sulfate (-SO4) and the nitrate (-NO3) are occasionally seen. Different salts dissolve to a greater or lesser extent in various solvents. The hydrochloride salt is polar in character and quite soluble in water.\n    Freebase: “Freebase” is the base form of cocaine, as opposed to the salt form. It is practically insoluble in water whereas hydrochloride salt is water soluble. This prevents cocaine in its basic form from being usable for sublingual usage and insufflation. Freebase cocaine can be treated with ethers, isopropyl alcohol, and hydrochloric acid to turn it into the salt form. \n    \"Crack\": Crack refers to a lower purity form of freebase cocaine that is usually produced by neutralization of cocaine hydrochloride with a solution of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and water, producing a very hard/brittle, off-white-to-brown colored, amorphous material that contains sodium carbonate, entrapped water, and other by-products as the main impurities. Smoking or vaporizing cocaine and inhaling it into the lungs produces an almost immediate \"high\" that can be very powerful and addictive. This initial buildup of stimulation is known as a \"rush\". While the stimulating effects may last for hours, the euphoric sensation is very brief, prompting the user to smoke more immediately.\n    Coca leaf infusions: Coca herbal infusion (also referred to as coca tea) is used in coca-leaf producing countries as much as any herbal medicinal infusion would be elsewhere in the world. The free and legal commercialization of dried coca leaves under the form of filtration bags to be used as \"coca tea\" has been actively promoted by the governments of Peru and Bolivia for many years as a drink having medicinal properties. The leaves are also very widely used by native populations for a variety of purposes including the treatment of altitude sickness.\n    Coca leaf chewing: Chewing the leaves with lime is also common in producing regions, which numbs the mouth and causes mild stimulation.",

In terms of neurotoxicity (as defined by the damage or death of cells in the brain in response to over-excitation or reactive oxidation caused by drugs), cocaine does not appear to exhibit these effects unlike certain other substances such as methamphetamine. Its extended use or abuse does, however, cause short-term down regulation of neurotransmitters.\n\nThe most potentially harmful physical effects of cocaine appear to be not neurological but cardiovascular. Severe cardiac adverse events, particularly sudden cardiac death, become a serious risk at high doses due to cocaine's blocking effect on cardiac sodium channels. Moreover, long-term cocaine use may result in cocaine-related cardiomyopathy.\n\nRegular cocaine insufflation, the most popular method of ingestion, can have extremely adverse effects on one's nostrils, nose, and nasal cavities. These include a loss of the sense of smell, nosebleeds, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or a chronically runny nose.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.",

Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational cocaine use but is unlikely to arise from typical medical use.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of cocaine develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Stimulants - When used in conjunction with other stimulants, the cardiovascular effects of cocaine such as increased heart rate become dangerously high. This is potentially fatal and severely increases the risk of cardiac arrest.\n    Depressants - Because depressants counteract some of the physical effects of cocaine (and vice-versa), the combination can lead users to underestimate the extent of their intoxication and consume larger doses than they otherwise would. Cocaine and opioids is a particularly dangerous combination because cocaine has a short half-life relative to most opioid drugs and as the effects of cocaine wear off, physical side-effects of the opioid can increase resulting in a delayed overdose with serious respiratory depression being a potentially fatal risk.\n    25x-NBOMe - Both the NBOMe series and this compound induce powerful stimulation and their interaction may cause severe side effects. These can include thought loops, seizures, increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and heart failure (in extreme cases).\n    Alcohol - When used in conjunction with alcohol, a portion of the cocaine undergoes transesterification with ethanol rather than undergoing hydrolysis with water which results in the production of cocaethylene. This creates significant changes in subjective effects such as a longer duration and increased euphoria. Some studies suggest, however, that this could potentially increase the cardiotoxic effects of cocaine to dangerous and unpredictable levels. It is also dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    DXM - This combination may cause increased heart rate and panic attacks.\n    MXE - Increased heart rate and blood pressure may occur.\n    Tramadol - This combination can increase the risk of seizures.\n    MDMA - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with cocaine.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants.\n    Nicotine - Many cocaine users find that consumption of tobacco products during cocaine use enhances the euphoria because nicotine increases the levels of dopamine in the brain. This, however, may have undesirable consequences such as uncontrollable chain smoking during cocaine use (even users who do not smoke cigarettes have been known to chain smoke when using cocaine) in addition to the detrimental health effects and the additional strain on the cardiovascular system caused by tobacco.",

It produces a unique mixture of stimulant, depressant and hallucinogenic effects when administered, which is typically done via smoking or oral administration.\n\nPharmacologically, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which makes up one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabigerol (CBG).\n\nContemporary uses of cannabis are as a recreational or medicinal drug, and as part of religious or spiritual rites. The earliest recorded uses date from the 3rd millennium BC.\n\nSince the early 20th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions with the possession, use, and sale of cannabis preparations containing psychoactive cannabinoids currently illegal in most countries of the world. The United Nations has said that cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the world. In 2004, the United Nations estimated that global consumption of cannabis indicated that approximately 4% of the adult world population (162 million people) used cannabis annually and that approximately 0.6% (22.5 million) of people used cannabis daily.",

The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.\n\nTHC appears to alter mood and cognition through its agonist actions on the CB1 receptors, which inhibit a secondary messenger system (adenylate cyclase) in a dose dependent manner. Via CB1 activation, THC indirectly increases dopamine release and produces psychotropic effects. Cannabidiol acts as an allosteric modulator of the mu and delta opioid receptors. THC also potentiates the effects of the glycine receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the cannabinoid high continues to remain elusive.",

                        "Psychedelics - When combined with psychedelics, both the visual and cognitive effects of cannabis can be intensified and extended with exceptional efficiency. This should be used with extreme caution, particularly if one is not experienced with psychedelics, as this can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and psychosis triggering aspects of psychedelics significantly. Due to this, it is generally advised to avoid in taking cannabis before well after the peak has passed to avoid triggering an overwhelming experience. Many users report that cannabis is effective at briefly recreating the peak of the experience if consumed during the come down phase.\n    Dissociatives - When combined with dissociatives, the dissociation, derealization, visuals, euphoria and other hallucinatory effects are typically greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of THC have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, as well as more intense internal hallucinations, and corresponding confusion which can spontaneously manifest as delusions and psychosis.\n    Depressants - When combined with depressants such as benzodiazepines or opioids, the hallucinogenic aspects of cannabis become minimized. Instead, the focus shifts to bodily sensations, such as muscle relaxation, sedation, information processing suppression, and anxiety suppression.\n        Alcohol - When combined with alcohol, cannabis often creates feelings of extreme nausea, double vision, dizziness and changes in gravity. It is generally recommended that people take the cannabis before drinking and not the other way around as this is reported to induce these effects less readily.\n    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs can suppress anxiety, panic attacks, and paranoia while on cannabis and make for a pleasant and calm experience. Examples of SSRIs include citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine.\n    Stimulants - When combined with stimulants, cannabis tends to increase their thought accelerating, immersion enhancing and euphoric effects, particularly as it relates to one's appreciation of music and sexual pleasure. This combination should be used with caution, however, as it can easily and unpredictably lead to states of anxiety, paranoia, confusion, delusions, and psychosis.",

A review published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in February 2001 said that \"no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported.\"\n\nTHC, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death. In lab animal tests, scientists have had much difficulty administering a dose of THC that is high enough to be lethal. The dose of THC needed to kill 50% of tested rodents is very high, 2.594 mol/kg, about 815.7 grams of THC per kilogram of body weight, and human deaths from overdose are unheard of.\n\nAt present, it is estimated that the LD50 of cannabis is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. This means that, in order to induce death, a cannabis smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much cannabis as is contained in one cannabis cigarette. A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of cannabis within about 15 minutes to induce a lethal response.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.",

                        "Cannabis is mildly habit-forming. Research has shown the overall addiction potential for cannabis to be less than that for caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, cocaine or heroin, but higher than that for psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD.\n\nDependence on cannabis is more common amongst heavy users. Marijuana use can lead to increased tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop. Prolonged marijuana usage requires the user to consume higher doses of the drug to achieve a common desirable effect (known as a higher tolerance), and reinforce the body's metabolic systems for synthesizing and eliminating the drug more efficiently.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of cannabis develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1 - 2 weeks for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 - 3 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Cannabis presents cross-tolerance with all cannabinoids, meaning that after the consumption of cannabis all cannabinoids will have a reduced effect. The mechanisms that create this tolerance to THC are thought to involve changes in cannabinoid receptor function.",

This may be because both of these substances can cause highly elevated states of anxiety, paranoia, and confusion, and being in the psychedelic state seem to leave one exceptionally vulnerable to these states, particularly in the form of thought loops. Anecdotally, many reports of extremely negative experiences involving psychedelics appear to share the common theme of having the decision to use cannabis act as the turning point for when the experience goes from enjoyable and manageable to sinister and overwhelming. Those who wish to consume cannabis on psychedelics are advised to exercise caution and only intake a fraction of their usual amount at spaced-out intervals.",

                        "4-Hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (commonly known as Psilocin, Psilocine, Psilocyn, Psilotsin, or abbreviated as 4-HO-DMT and 4-OH-DMT) is a naturally-occurring psychedelic substance of the tryptamine chemical class that produces what are now typically considered to be \"classical psychedelic\" effects (i.e. those associated with LSD, Mescaline, Psilocybin and DMT) when administered. It is known as the primary psychoactive constituent in certain species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, and as a closely related structural analog of the powerful visionary entheogen DMT (also known as N,N-dimethyltryptamine), which it shares many core subjective features with.\n\nPsilocin and its phosphorylated inactive precursor (i.e. prodrug) psilocybin were first isolated and named in 1958 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann. Hofmann obtained the chemicals from laboratory-grown specimens of the entheogenic mushroom Psilocybe mexicana before proceeding to find their synthetic routes. Psilocin's psychoactivity is thought to emerge from the close structural similarities that it shares on a molecular level with serotonin (5-hydroxy-trypamine), which enables it to interact with a wide range of serotonin receptor sites distributed throughout the brain and central nervous system that are integral for sensory input processing and higher-order cognitive processes. It is believed to exert most of its characteristic psychedelic activity by binding to serotonin-2A or 5-HT-2A receptors with an atypically high degree of selectivity (please see this page for more information).\n\nNotably, while psilocin naturally co-occurs with psilocybin in significant amounts of most psychedelic or psilocybin-containing mushrooms, it is only ever rarely encountered in its isolated synthetic form. Those who have had the opportunity to experiment with synthetic psilocin powder have reported it to be a powerful, visionary substituted tryptamine with a deep, all-encompassing headspace, immersive visuals with high-level geometry, and a rapid challenging come up that is both reportedly more lucid and anxiety-provoking than orally ingested psilocybin mushrooms; this may make the experience overly intense for those who are not well versed with psychedelics.\n\nAs with psychedelics in general, psilocin is not considered to be addictive by the research and medical community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, delusions and psychotic breaks can still always occur, particularly among those predisposed to psychiatric disorders. While these negative reactions or \"bad trips\" can often be attributed to factors like the inexperience or improper preparation of the user's set and setting, they have been known to happen spontaneously among even the most experienced of users as well. This is why despite its scientifically-backed reputation for possessing negligible toxicity, it is still highly advised to approach this potent, unpredictable, hallucinogenic substance with the proper amount of precaution and harm reduction practices if one chooses to use it.",

                        "Psilocin, or 4-HO-DMT, is an organic indole alkaloid molecule of the tryptamine class of chemicals. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-DMT is substituted at R4 of its indole heterocycle with an hydroxyl (-OH) functional group; it also contains two methyl groups CH3- bound to the terminal amine RN of the ethyl side chain. This makes psilocin the 4-hydroxy structural analog of DMT, and dephosphorylated analog of psilocybin.\n\nPsilocin can be obtained by dephosphorylation of natural psilocybin under strongly acidic or under alkaline conditions via hydrolysis, which is how it becomes metabolically active in the human body as well.\n\nIn terms of its physical properties, 4-HO-DMT is relatively unstable in solution due to its phenolic hydroxy (-OH) group. In the presence of oxygen it readily forms bluish and dark black degradation products. For this reason it is recommended to store it in optimal chemical storage conditions (i.e. cool, dry, away from light) to avoid excessive degradation.",

This should be used with extreme caution, especially if one is not experienced with psychedelics. This interaction can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and psychotomimetic producing aspects of cannabis significantly. The THC and psilocin synergy is unique in that the severity of its mind-altering qualities can greatly depend on when during the trip the cannabis is taken, as psilocin experiences are often considered to have less continuity than many other commonly used psychedelics.\n    Dissociatives - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of psilocin can result in significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, along with more intense internal hallucinations, confusion, nausea, delusions and chances of a psychotic reaction.\n    MDMA - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of psilocin are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric bliss manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful, intricate and majestic visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually.\n    Alcohol - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause dehydration, depression, nausea and thought disorganization which can negatively affect a trip if taken in high dosages. This combination is however reasonably safe in low doses and when used responsibly, this can often take the edge off a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, it is, however, more stressful on the body. With psilocybin mushrooms in particular it is often recommended that the user wait until the come down before they indulge in the consumption of alcohol due to the sometimes already nauseating and lumbering physical effects of mushrooms, especially within the first 2 - 3 hours of the trip. With pure psilocin these physical effects can appear to be less intense but are still generally not recommended due to the infamously unpredictable and purportedly even perilous nature of the psilocin and ethanol synergy. It also is worth noting that experiencing psilocybin/psilocin while feeling the after effects of alcohol can present substantially negative psychological reactions and a significant risk for bad trips that is uniquely higher with psilocin than it is with other common psychedelics.\n    Benzodiazepines - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of a psilocin trip. They can be very efficient at largely stopping or mitigating a bad trip at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose, however, due to the very high addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.",

                        "Lysergic acid diethylamide (also known as Lysergide, LSD-25, LSD, L, Lucy, and Acid) is an iconic semisynthetic psychedelic substance of the lysergamide chemical class that produces what are now considered to be \"classical psychedelic\" effects (i.e. those associated with mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, and DMT) when administered.\n\nLSD was initially synthesized by the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1938, but its profound mind altering effects were not discovered until he accidentally exposed himself to it in 1943. In 1947, LSD was introduced to the world as a commercial medication under the trade-name Delysid for various psychiatric applications.\n\nFollowing its release, LSD had an immediate and profound impact in the areas of scientific research and psychiatry. In the 15 or so year period following its release, research on LSD and other hallucinogens generated over 1,000 scientific papers and was ultimately prescribed to over 40,000 patients. During this time, it was selected for investigation by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a potential mind control agent in a clandestine project named MK-ULTRA. Its subsequent proselytization and widespread adoption for recreational and proclaimed spiritual purposes by the Western youth counterculture of the 1960s eventually resulted in its global prohibition in 1971.\n\nLSD is commonly distributed in various forms for oral or sublingual administration. It is one of the few psychedelic substances potent enough to fit onto small squares of \"blotter paper\", and has a long history of being counterfeited by a select few similarly potent psychedelics that are known to be significantly less safe (see below).\n\nAmong other things, LSD has been noted for its elusiveness, impact on various youth subcultures and alternative spiritualities, the arbitrariness of the soft prohibition on its research, as well as the relative difficulty of producing it in a clandestine context. It is considered by some to be an example of the world's first modern entheogen, a category which had until that point been limited to traditional plant preparations.\n\nUnlike most highly prohibited substances, LSD is not considered to be addictive or toxic by the scientific community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as uncontrollable anxiety, paranoia, delusions and psychotic breaks can always occur, particularly among those who are predisposed to mental disorders. While these negative reactions or \"bad trips\" are often attributable to user inexperience or improper preparation of set and setting, they have been known to spontaneously happen among even the most experienced of users as well.\n\nFor this reason, it is highly advised to approach this very powerful, long-lasting, and unpredictable hallucinogenic substance with the proper amount of precaution and harm reduction practices if choosing to use it.",

                        "LSD was first synthesized on November 16, 1938, by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland as part of a large research program searching for medically useful ergot alkaloid derivatives. The abbreviated form of LSD comes from its early research code name LSD-25 which is an abbreviation for the German spelling \"Lysergsäure-diethylamid\" followed by a sequential number. However, its psychedelic properties were not discovered until five years later when Hofmann purported to accidentally ingest an unknown quantity of the chemical before proceeding on a bike ride home. This event would be come to be known as \"Bicycle Day\", and is celebrated to this day.\n\nThe first intentional ingestion of LSD occurred on April 19, 1943, when Hofmann ingested 250 micrograms (µg) of LSD, believing it would be a threshold dose based on the dosages of other ergot alkaloids. Hofmann found the effects to be much stronger than he anticipated and was impressed and puzzled by its radically mind-altering effects. In 1947, Sandoz Laboratories introduced LSD to the world as a psychiatric drug and made it easily accessible for research and novel therapeutic purposes.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency began a research program code named MK-ULTRA and investigated the compound for potential applications in mind control, chemical warfare, and the development of a 'truth serum.' Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions, usually without the subjects' knowledge, and resulted in at least one death. The project was revealed in the U.S. congressional United States President's Commission on CIA activities called Rockefeller Commission report in 1975.\n\nIn 1963, the Sandoz patents expired on LSD. Several prominent intellectuals, including Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, and Al Hubbard, began to advocate for the consumption of LSD. LSD became central to the counterculture of the 1960s. In the early 1960s, the use of LSD and other hallucinogens was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Leary, Huxley, Alan Watts and Arthur Koestler and according to L. R. Veysey, they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth.\n\nOn October 24, 1968, possession of LSD was made illegal in the United States. The last FDA approved study of LSD in patients ended in 1980, while a study in healthy volunteers was made in the late 1980s. Legally approved and regulated psychiatric use of LSD continued in Switzerland until 1993.\n\nIn popular culture, the Grateful Dead became inextricably linked to LSD in the United States, and Grateful Dead concerts provided the primary distribution network for LSD through the mid-1990s.",

                        "LSD, or d-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a semisynthetic alkaloid of the lysergamide family. LSD contains a core structure of lysergic acid, with an N,N-diethylamide functional group bound to RN of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure of LSD is an indole derivative and has tryptamine and phenethylamine groups embedded within it.\n\nLSD's structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole ring fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (lysergic acid). At carbon 8 of the quinoline an N, generally N-diethyl carboxamide is bound, LSD is additionally substituted at carbon 6 with a methyl group. LSD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R5 and R8. LSD, also called (+)-D-LSD, has an absolute configuration of (5R, 8R). The three other stereoisomers of LSD do not have psychoactive properties.\nBinding affinities of LSD for various receptors. The lower the dissociation constant (Ki), the more strongly LSD binds to that receptor (i.e. with higher affinity). The horizontal line represents an approximate value for human plasma concentrations of LSD, and hence, receptor affinities that are above the line are unlikely to be involved in LSD's effect. Data averaged from data from the Ki Database.\n\nIn terms of its physical properties, LSD is sensitive to oxygen, ultraviolet light, and chlorine (especially in solution). Its potency may last for years if it is stored away from light and moisture at cold temperatures around 0°C or below, but will slowly degrade at normal room temperature (25°C). In one study, there was a 10% loss of potency after LSD was kept at room temperature for one month. However, there are also many anecdotal reports from users who have successfully stored LSD at room temperature for years which contradict the findings of this study.",

LSD binds to most serotonin receptor subtypes except for 5-HT3 and 5-HT4. 5-HT5B receptors, which have not been found in humans, also have a high affinity for LSD. The psychedelic effects are thought to come from LSD's efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptors.\n\nLSD also possesses efficacy at all dopamine and all adrenoreceptors. Most serotonergic psychedelics are not significantly dopaminergic, so LSD is therefore rather unique in this regard. LSD's agonism of D2 receptors has been shown to contribute to its psychoactivity.\n\nHowever, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain the subject of ongoing scientific inquiry.",

                        "Cannabis - When used in combination with cannabis, both the sensory and cognitive effects of LSD become intensified and extended with exceptional efficiency. This should be used with extreme caution, particularly if one is not experienced with psychedelics, as this combination has been well-observed to amplify the anxiety, confusion and psychosis inducing aspects of both substances significantly. It is often reported that being under the influence of psychedelics temporarily reduces one's cannabis tolerance to subjectively baseline levels. Those who choose to use this combination are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take at least 20-minute breaks between hits in order to avoid spiralling negative reactions.\n    Dissociatives - When used in combination with dissociatives, the dissociative, cognitive, visuals and general hallucinatory effects become greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of LSD have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone, as well as more intense internal hallucinations, and corresponding confusion which can spontaneously manifest as delusions and psychosis.\n    MDMA - When combined with MDMA, the physical, cognitive, and euphoric effects of MDMA become amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of LSD can also be intensified to the point of overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs, headspaces, and uniquely colorful and intricate visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is advised to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. Additionally, users should be aware that there are reasons to believe that this combination may result in unforeseen neurotoxic effects, so a strong sense of caution and independent research are highly advised if one decides to experiment with this combination.\n    Alcohol - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause dehydration and nausea and physical fatigue which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. This combination is, however, reasonably safe in low doses and can often \"take the edge off\" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit in a more physically draining way.\n    Benzodiazepines - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of an LSD trip. They are very efficient at stopping \"bad trips\" at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to the very high addictive potential that benzodiazepines possess.\n    Psychedelics - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.",

                        "N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (also known as DMT, N,N-DMT, Dimethyltryptamine, Dmitri, and \"The Spirit Molecule\") is an infamous naturally-occurring psychedelic substance of the tryptamine chemical class that produces an unusually intense, short-lived version of what has come to be considered the \"classical psychedelic\" experience (i.e. those traditionally associated with Mescaline, Psilocybin Mushrooms, DMT, and LSD) when administered.\n\nDepending on the dosage and method of administration, the effects of DMT can range from mild psychedelic states to powerfully immersive life-altering experiences which are often described as the ultimate displacement from ordinary consciousness, in which users are placed in a subjective state where they can experience exploring ineffable spiritual realms or alternate dimensions.\n\nDMT is present in over 65 species of plants and has been identified as being a normal constituent of human metabolism and an endogenous neurotransmitter in certain rodents. Its presence is also known to be widespread throughout the plant kingdom. Although various theories have been postulated, the substance's neurobiological function has yet to be determined.\n\nIn modern times, DMT is viewed as an extremely powerful visionary psychedelic entheogen that, when vaporized or smoked, produces short-lived effects with a very rapid onset that are sometimes compared to an \"unimaginably high-speed roller-coaster ride.\" When ingested in combination with a MAOI or RIMA agent, it becomes active orally and thus significantly longer lasting, immersive, and interactive in nature; this combination is known as ayahuasca. Ayahuasca brews have been used traditionally in South America since at least around the year 1500.\n\nUnlike most highly prohibited substances, DMT is not considered to be physiologically toxic or addictive by the scientific community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, delusions and psychotic breaks can always still occur, particularly among those predisposed to psychiatric disorders. While these negative reactions or \"bad trips\" can often be attributed to user inexperience or improper preparation of set and setting, they have been known to happen spontaneously among even the most experienced of users as well.\n\nAs a result, it is highly advised to approach this incredibly powerful and unpredictable hallucinogenic substance with proper harm reduction practices if choosing to use it.",

This is followed by a sudden onset of high level 3 geometry which increases in its intensity until it envelopes and covers the external environment. These effects are often accompanied by auditory hallucinations such as soft crackling sounds or high pitched extended tones. There is also the possibility of accompanying physical sensations as one \"breaks through.\" These can include feelings of suddenly being pushed through and onto the other side of a membrane or feelings of shooting through space at high speeds.\n2. \"The Waiting Room\"\n\nAlmost immediately after a person has inhaled enough DMT to have \"broken through\", they often find themselves spending a brief amount of time in what is sometimes described as a psychedelic \"waiting room\" or \"loading screen.\" The appearance of this space can assume a seemingly infinite variety of forms but generally appears in the shape of an enveloping tunnel comprised of rapidly shifting, interlocking geometry. This lasts approximately 10 – 20 seconds and feels qualitatively different from other stages of the experience.\n3. \"The Other Side\"\n\nOnce the waiting period is over, the user will feel that they have \"broken through\" onto the other side. It is here where users experience intense level 7 geometry and level 3 - 4 internal hallucinations. It is worth noting that although experiences vary between individuals, DMT trips often follow common archetypes, scenarios, content, and plots. These scenarios generally consist of visiting what appears to be an alternate reality that is often described to contain autonomous entities, settings, sceneries, and landscapes as well as themes of a cosmic, transcendental, or transpersonal nature.\n4. \"Drifting Down\"\n\nThe final stage is experienced as the sensation of being pulled further and further away from the scenario until it is no longer visible and one finds themselves back in reality. This is typically accompanied by level 3 - 4 geometry as well as a sense of general exhilaration and awe. The moderate to mild geometry stays for a further 10 – 15 minutes before disappearing completely, sometimes leaving a noticeable \"body high\" that lingers for up to an hour.",

                        "Ayahuasca (pronounced /eye-uh-WAHS-kuh/ and also known as Yagé) is an umbrella term that refers to a wide variety of traditional and modern brews and infusions of natural plant sources that produce powerful psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects. Of these, it most commonly consists of a DMT-containing plant source in combination with one that contains an MAOI or RIMA (typically sources like B. caapi vine or syrian rue) to produce uniquely potent, sometimes medicinal, psychedelic effects.\n\nThe co-consumption of a MAOI agent is necessary for the combination work, as the DMT molecule (which is a monoamine closely related to serotonin) is rendered almost entirely inactive when digested by itself due to the presence of a monoamine oxidase enzymes in the stomach, which rapidly degrades it.\n\nAyahuasca is used as a traditional spiritual medicine in ceremonies among the Indigenous peoples of Amazonian Peru, many of whom say that they received the instructions in its use directly from the plants and plant spirits themselves. Ayahuasca was first described outside of Indigenous communities in the early 1950s by Harvard ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, who became aware of the Native communities who use it for divinatory and healing purposes.\n\nAs is the case with psychedelics in general, ayahuasca is not considered to be dependence-forming or addictive by the research and medical community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, delusions and psychotic breaks can still always occur, particularly among those predisposed to psychiatric disorders. While these negative reactions or \"bad trips\" can often be attributed to factors like the user's inexperience or improper preparation of their set and setting, they have been known to happen spontaneously among even the most experienced of users as well. This is why despite its scientifically-backed reputation for possessing both negligible-to-no physical and neurotoxicity, it is still highly advised to approach this powerful and unpredictable hallucinogenic substance with the proper amount of precaution, and harm reduction practices if one chooses to use it.",

The ingredient known to cause problems is known specifically as brugmansia, which can cause issues when co-administered with an MAOI. An effective ayahuasca brew does not have to be more complicated than a suitable source of DMT (such as mimosa or acacia) and a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA or MAOI). Using other ingredients along with the ayahuasca can potentially be dangerous; any potential interactions should be carefully researched before ingestion.\n\nAnother concern of ayahuasca ceremonies is the culture of mysticism and pseudoscience produced from centuries of mythological ritual, leading to a bias following the delusion of a single cultural narrative. There is an irrational belief that ayahuasca should only to be used in the Amazon rainforest in the presence of a shaman. This belief leads many to shun the idea of taking ayahuasca outside of this potentially toxic environment for no logical reason.",

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific eludication.\n\nHarmala alkaloids are classed as MAO-inhibiting beta-carbolines. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the B. caapi vine are harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine. Harmine and harmaline are selective and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).\n\nThis inhibition of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, eventually crossing the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or MAOIs of MAO-A, DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.",

It is a popular member of the 2C-x family of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which are derivatives of mescaline.\n\n2C-B was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. In Shulgin's book, PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 16–24 mg. 2C-B is sold as a white powder sometimes pressed in tablets or gel caps and is supposedly referred to on the street as 'Venus', 'B's', 'CB's', or 'Nexus'. The drug is usually taken orally, but can also be taken by rectal or intravenous administration, insufflated or vaporized.\n\nIt first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy. It was considered one of the best substances for this purpose because of its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature. Shortly after becoming popular in the medical community, it became popular recreationally.\n\n2C-B was first sold commercially as an aphrodisiac under the trade name \"Eros,\" which was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company Drittewelle. For several years, it was available as tablets in Dutch smart shops under the name \"Nexus.\" In modern times it is used as a recreational substance, psychotherapy aid, and an entheogen.\n\nThis particular substance is part of the so-called \"magical half-dozen\" which refers to Alexander Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of PiHKAL, and are as follows: Mescaline, DOM, 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7.",

                        "2C-B was first synthesized and discovered by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. He later published his findings on 2C-B in his 1991 book PiHKAL, and included it among the \"magical half dozen\" of psychedelic phenethylamines he deemed most important. In interviews, Alexander Shulgin has repeatedly declared it his favorite psychedelic trip.\n\nIn the 1970s, 2C-B was used in patients by a small number of psychotherapists in the United States. These therapists reported the drug created a warm, empathetic bond between them and their patients. The therapists also said the drug helped break down a patient's ego defenses and inner resistances, allowing the patient to get in touch with suppressed emotions and repressed memories. The gentle nature of 2C-B, in addition to its mild side effects and short duration, was found to be desirable traits for in the therapeutic setting.\n\nNot long after the drug gained traction in the medical community, 2C-B became popular in the recreational drug scene. 2C-B was well liked as an MDMA substitute ideal for raves and parties with minimal comedown and a clear euphoric headspace.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, several foreign companies legitimately manufactured 2C-B under the brand names Nexus, Erox, and Performax and advertised that it would alleviate impotence, frigidity, and diminished libido. It was sold at adult book and video stores, \"head\" shops, and some nightclubs. The DEA reported it to be sold in Miami, FL as yellow pills marketed as an aphrodisiac.\n\nAfter MDMA was classified as Schedule I by the United States in 1985, 2C-B gained popularity as an alternative to the now illegal party drug. Its increasing popularity caused it to be placed in Schedule I in 1995. Its use has since seen a resurgence due to the advent of online research chemical vendors.\n\n2C-B is used as entheogen by the Sangoma, Nyanga, and Amagqirha people over their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as Ubulawu Nomathotholo, which roughly translates to \"Medicine of the Singing Ancestors\".",

                        "Cannabis - When used in combination with cannabis, both the visual and cognitive effects of 2C-B can be intensified and extended with extreme efficiency. This should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics as this can also amplify the anxiety, confusion and psychosis producing aspects of cannabis significantly.\n    Dissociatives - When used in combination with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced holes, spaces, and voids while under the influence of 2C-B have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone present, and more intense internal hallucinations, and corresponding confusion which can spontaneously manifest as delusions and psychosis.\n    Nitrous - Nitrous oxide (\"Laughing gas\") is commonly used in combination with psychedelics. The two are known to possess powerful cross-synergistic effects, including the capacity to send the user directly into an \"ego death\" state. The speed and intensity with which this occurs is very rapid and the euphoria that can result often leads to the urge to compulsively redose.\n    MDMA - When used in conjunction with MDMA, the physical and cognitive effects of MDMA are amplified. The visual, physical and cognitive effects of 2C-B are also intensified with an overwhelming euphoric pleasure manifested through uniquely pleasurable body highs and headspaces, and uniquely colorful and awe-inspiring visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is best to start with markedly lower dosages than one would take for both substances individually. Additionally, users should be aware that there are reasons to believe that this combination may result in unforeseen neurotoxic effects, so a strong sense of caution and independent research are highly advised if one decides to experiment with this combination.\n    Alcohol - This interaction is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause dehydration and nausea and physical fatigue which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. This combination is, however, reasonably safe in low doses and can often \"take the edge off\" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a fashion somewhat similar to benzodiazepines, albeit in a more physically taxing way.\n    Benzodiazepines - When used in combination with benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines can, depending on the dosage, slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical and visual effects of an 2C-B experience. They are very efficient at stopping \"bad trips\" at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to the very high dependence and addiction potential that benzodiazepines possess.\n    Psychedelics - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.",

It is widely used in human and veterinary medicine, primarily for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia for surgical procedures.\n\nOther medical applications of ketamine include sedation and anesthesia in intensive care situations, particularly in emergency medicine, and in the treatment of bronchospasm (i.e. a sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the lungs bronchioles).\n\nKetamine was originally developed as a medicine in 1965 as a derivative and successor to PCP, the modern world's first synthetic general anesthetic agent, which was synthesized in 1926. While possessing recreational properties that led to its rise in popularity in the 1970s, it remains a core medicine in the World Health Organization’s “Essential Drugs List”, a list of the safest and most effective drugs needed in a modern health system.\n\nLike other dissociative substances of its class such, as methoxetamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it is primarily sought by recreational users for its ability to induce a hallucinogenic \"out of body\" state referred to as \"dissociative anesthesia\" (although the extent to which this occurs is highly dose-dependent).\n\nIn addition to its widespread use as a licit medicine, ketamine is also is commonly used today for recreational purposes and more rarely and controversially, as an entheogenic substance.",

Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually the notorious state known as the “K-hole”.\n\nAt high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to μ-opioid receptors type 2 in cultured human neuroblastoma cells without agonist activity and to sigma receptors in rats. Also, ketamine interacts with muscarinic receptors, descending monoaminergic pain pathways and voltage-gated calcium channels. At subanesthetic and fully anesthetic doses, ketamine has been found to block serotonin depletion in the brain by inhibiting 5-HT receptors rather than through monoamine oxidase inhibition.",

                        "Fatal ketamine overdoses are particularly rare, but not unheard of. However, the exact toxic dosage is unknown.\n\nThe first large-scale, longitudinal study of ketamine users found that frequent ketamine users (at least 4 days/week, averaging 20 days/month) had increased depression and impaired memory by several measures, including verbal, short-term memory and visual memory. However, infrequent (1–4 days/month, averaging 3.25 days/month) ketamine users and former ketamine users were not found to differ from controls in memory, attention and psychological well-being tests. This suggests the infrequent use of ketamine does not cause cognitive deficits and that any deficits that might occur may be reversible when ketamine use is discontinued. However, abstinent, frequent, and infrequent users all scored higher than controls on a test of delusional symptoms.\n\nShort-term exposure of cultures of GABAergic neurons to ketamine at high concentrations led to a significant loss of differentiated cells in one study, and non-cell death-inducing concentrations of ketamine (10 μg/ml) may still initiate long-term alterations of the dendritic arbor in differentiated neurons. The same study also demonstrated chronic (>24 h) administration of ketamine at concentrations as low as 0.01 μg/ml can interfere with the maintenance of dendritic arbor architecture. These results raise the possibility that chronic exposure to low, subanesthetic concentrations of ketamine, while not affecting cell survival, could still impair neuronal morphology and thus might lead to dysfunctions of neural networks. \n\nMore recent studies of ketamine-induced neurotoxicity have focused on primates in an attempt to use a more accurate model than rodents. One such study administered daily ketamine doses consistent with typical recreational doses (1 mg/kg IV) to adolescent cynomolgus monkeys for varying periods of time. Decreased locomotor activity and indicators of increased cell death in the prefrontal cortex were detected in monkeys given daily injections for six months, but not those given daily injections for one month.\n\nStudies have shown that the serotonin systems affected by such serotonergic drugs are linked to the NMDA/glutamate systems. Tests on rats indicate that 5-HT agonists like LSD and psilocybin can prevent neurotoxicity due to NMDA receptor antagonists.",

                        "As with other NMDA receptor antagonists, the chronic use of ketamine can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of ketamine develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Ketamine presents cross-tolerance with all dissociatives, meaning that after the consumption of ketamine all dissociatives will have a reduced effect.\n\nThe following is a summary on the subject of ketamine dependence from the book Ketamine: Dreams and Realities by Karl Jansen, M.D. and Ph.D.:\n\n    \"With repeated long-term use, the effects may increasingly come to resemble a mixture of cocaine, opium, Cannabis, and alcohol, and become less and less psychedelic. While tolerance is rapid and marked, the ability to remember the experience also fades.\"\n    \"My view is that ketamine is far more likely to create periods of dependence than any other psychedelic drug. In my opinion, the group who lose control over their use is unlikely to exceed 15% of those who fine the experience rewarding. This minority, however, is particularly likely to publish its stories; its members were often high profile mind-explorers before they became over-involved with ketamine (e.g. Moore, Lilly, and Turner). The risk is certainly very high in comparison with drugs such as LSD, DMT, and psilocybian mushrooms, but it is not more than half of those who like it.\"\n    \"A break of several years does not usually reverse tolerance to the psychedelic effects. The “no way back” situation applies to a wide range of drugs. Some heroin users are always trying to get back to the “first blush” but are unable to do so, even on near-lethal doses. Some persons with alcohol dependence can drink until they collapse without becoming merry. Some heavy MDMA users can still not find the “love effect,” even with 250 mg i.v. of dissolved pure powder. There are heavy cocaine and amphetamine users who, by the time they give up, many become paranoid each time they use rather than euphoric. After years of abstinence, 10 minutes into a relapse they become paranoid again. The experience will be closer to the last time they used rather than the first. In a similar manner, if heavy ketamine users take a break for a year and then resume, the effect is often the way they left it at the end rather than the way it was at the outset. It seems that there is no way for the journey to begin again at its original departure point. This persistent change has both a mental and a physical basis.\"",

There is also evidence that suggests that combining these two increases their neurotoxicity.

When consumed, these mushrooms produce \"classical psychedelic\" effects (i.e. those associated with Mescaline, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms and DMT).\n\nAs the name implies, the principal psychoactive component of these mushrooms is psilocybin, which is thought to be converted into psilocin in the body before exerting their characteristic psychedelic effects. Both psilocybin and psilocin share a close structural relationship with the powerful visionary entheogen DMT, as well as the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin.\n\nPsilocybin mushrooms have been noted for their connection to a number of shamanic and ceremonial traditions among various cultures that used these mushrooms to produce visionary or entheogenic states of consciousness for spiritual or religious purposes.\n\nUnlike most highly prohibited substances, psilocybin-containing mushrooms are not considered to be toxic or addictive by the scientific community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as anxiety, paranoia, delusions and psychotic breaks can still always occur, particularly among those predisposed to psychiatric conditions. While these negative reactions or \"bad trips\" can often be attributed to factors like the user's inexperience or inadequate preparation of set and setting, they have been known to happen spontaneously among even the most experienced of users as well.",

Its unique structure lacks features commonly associated with opioid ligand binding, namely it doesn't contain a quaternary carbon atom linked to a tertiary amine group by two other carbon atoms. Unlike traditional opioid agonists, salvinorin A targets the κ-opioid receptor rather than the μ-opioid receptor. Salvinorin A is currently being researched in relation to its properties as an anti-addiction drug, and several analogs with improved pharmacokinetic profiles have been shown to have anti-addictive effects as well.\n\nHowever, the role of these interactions and how they result in a hallucinogenic experience continues to remain the subject of ongoing scientific inquiry.",

Isopropyl nitrite became popular due to a ban on isobutyl nitrite in the European Union in 2007. The compound butyl nitrite is more rarely sold.\n\nPoppers were part of the club culture from the 1970s disco scene to the 1980s. The 1990s rave scene made their use popular.",

The decomposition products are oxides of nitrogen, water and the alcohol as well as polymerization products of the aldehyde.\n\nThe decomposition of alkyl nitrites is different with each one; the original nitrite, amyl nitrite, has a relatively high rate of decomposition and isopropyl nitrite, the nitrite most commonly used today, has a slow decomposition.",

A study and ranking of drugs for harmfulness devised by British government advisers and based upon health professionals opinions of harm to both individuals and society placed alkyl nitrites among the less harmful substances when compared to other recreational drugs including alcohol and tobacco. The primary risk of popper usage is a chemical burn if spilled on one's skin.\n\nAll forms of alkyl nitrites are highly flammable and should not be used if one is smoking or has candles nearby.\n\nAlkyl nitrites are a possible and rare cause of concern in a small number of cases of maculopathy (eye damage) in recent case reports from UK and France. Some studies have concluded that there may be increased risk for at least temporary retinal damage with habitual popper use in certain users; in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, an ophthalmologist described four cases in which recreational users of poppers experienced temporary changes in vision. Another study described foveal (daylight vision) damage in six habitual poppers users. In 2014, optometrists and ophthalmologists reported having noticed an increase in vision loss in chronic poppers users in the UK associated with isopropyl nitrite being substituted for isobutyl nitrite in 2006.",

                        "Nitrous oxide (also known as Laughing gas, Nitrous, NOS, Balloons, or Whippets) is a widely used inorganic molecule with psychoactive properties. At room temperature, it is as a colorless and non-flammable gas with a slightly sweet odor and taste that produces short-lived atypical dissociative and euphoric effects when inhaled.\n\nThe gas was first synthesized by English natural philosopher and chemist Joseph Priestley in 1772, who called it phlogisticated nitrous air (see phlogiston). It was first used as an anesthetic drug in the treatment of a patient when dentist Horace Wells demonstrated insensitivity to pain from a dental extraction on 11 December 1844.\n\nIt widely used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as \"laughing gas\" due to the euphoric effects that occur upon inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as an atypical dissociative anesthetic. The duration of these effects is approximately 2 - 5 minutes in length.\n\nIt is also used as an oxidizer in rocketry and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen.\n\nThe recreational use of nitrous oxide began at \"laughing gas parties\" primarily arranged for the British upper class in 1799 and has continued into modern times as the gas has become cheaper and more accessible to the masses. Today it is used worldwide by hospitals and dentists alike as a general anesthetic.",

The another form has the central nitrogen atom double bonded to both the other nitrogen atom as well as the oxygen atom. Both forms create formal charges on two of the atoms, which neutralize over the molecule. It was first synthesized by heating ammonium nitrate in the presence of iron filings and then passing the gas that came off (NO) through the water. Now it is commonly synthesized by gently heating ammonium nitrate to decompose it into nitrous oxide. It is an oxide of nitrogen.",

NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually the famous “hole”.\n\nThe pharmacological mechanism of action behind N2O in medicine is not entirely known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of receptors and this likely plays a significant role in many of its effects. It moderately blocks β2-subunit-containing nACh channels, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABAC, and 5-HT3 receptors and slightly potentiates GABAA and glycine receptors. It has also been shown to activate two-pore-domain K+ channels.",

This is alongside a sudden and dramatic ego death.\n    Dissociatives - When taken in combination with a classical dissociative such as MXE or DXM, the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in disconnective effects and the triggering of a sudden internal hallucinatory scenario.\n    Cannabis - When taken in combination with cannabis, the overall effects of the nitrous itself are potentiated more so than the cannabis' effects.\n    Alcohol - When taken in combination with alcohol, adverse side effects such as confusion, dizziness, and headaches are often significantly increased.",

Potential problems include:\n\n    Brain injury and suffocation can result from lack of oxygen. When used as an anesthetic, nitrous is always administered in combination with oxygen. Never use nitrous in any manner that does not provide for adequate oxygen intake.\n    Very cold temperatures of the gas can freeze the lips and throat if taken directly from a tank or whippet. Releasing the gas into a balloon first allows the gas to warm before being administered.\n    Heavy and frequent long-term nitrous use can deplete vitamin B12 in the body and lead to serious and unpleasant neurological problems. Users may experience numbness and tingle in the fingers, toes, lips, et al. In more severe cases, there will be numbness of all extremities. Taking B12 supplements, especially in combination with a multivitamin and complete amino acid supplements, may help alleviate this problem. If one experiences these symptoms, nitrous use should be ceased immediately, and if the symptoms persist, medical attention should be sought after.\n    Nitric oxide, a toxic industrial gas, is occasionally mistaken for nitrous oxide. Users should be careful they know what they are inhaling. Inhaling Nitric Oxide can permanently damage the lungs or kill.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.",

This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement. The bioavailability of orally administered methadone can vary from 40% to around 99%. Methadone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system.\n\nUnlike most opioids, methadone is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well as a weak NMDA antagonist. Similarly to dextropropoxyphene, methadone is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist.\nBinding affinities (Ki)\n\n    Mu opioid agonist - 24.8 nM\n    Kappa opioid agonist - 543 nM\n    Delta opioid agonist - 1674 nM",

                        "As with other opioids, the chronic use of methadone can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of methadone develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methadone presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of methadone all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\nThe risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and relapse, largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual dosage if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.",

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL, methaqualone, opioids) - This combination potentiates the muscle relaxation, amnesia, sedation, and respiratory depression caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of vomiting while unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If nausea or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n\n    Stimulants - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with stimulants due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified disinhibition, motor control loss, and dangerous black-out states. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.\n\n    Dissociatives - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the amnesia, sedation, motor control loss and delusions that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of respiratory depression. If nausea or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    Psychedelics - Methadone is known to lower the seizure threshold and psychedelics may act as triggers for seizures in those who are susceptible to them.\n\nSerotonin syndrome risk\n\nWhile methadone has been reported to occasionally cause serotonin syndrome when combined with certain substances (such as those listed below), anecdotal reports suggests that it does so at a much lower rate than tramadol. Combinations in the list below may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels.\n\n    MAOIs such as syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants\n    Serotonin releasers such as MDMA, 4-FA, MDAI and αMT\n    Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n    Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n    5-HTP",

It is a narcotic analgesic used orally as a cough suppressant, but also commonly taken orally for relief of moderate to severe pain. Those who take hydrocodone for recreational purposes report a sense of relaxation and euphoria, especially at higher doses.\n\nHydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States, with the International Narcotics Control Board reporting that 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States.\n\nLike many opioids, such as dextropropoxyphene, hydrocodone is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to enhance analgesia and deter abuse. Acetaminophen overdoses and long-term use, often due to recreational use, can cause serious or fatal liver damage. Currently, the only brand of hydrocodone in the United States that does not have acetaminophen is Zohydro ER which comes in doses of up to 50mg.",

Hydrocodone and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen-containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13, with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\nHydrocodone, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. It contains a carbonyl group bound at R6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17. The carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl saturates the benzene ring it is bonded with, thus hydrocodone lacks the double bond on that ring found in codeine.\n\nHydrocodone also shares the 3-methoxy substitution found in codeine; the two differ only from their R6 substituents. Hydrocodone is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, codeine, and oxycodone.",

This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's effects.

As with all opioids, long-term effects can vary but can include diminished libido, apathy and memory loss. Some people may also have an allergic reaction to hydrocodone, such as the swelling of skin and rashes. It is potentially fatal at heavy dosages.\n\nLike most opioids, unadulterated hydrocodone at appropriate dosages does not cause many long-term complications other than dependence and constipation. Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking the necessary precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure products.\n\nHeavy dosages of hydrocodone can result in respiratory depression, leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nHydrocodone can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position). In case of overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of naloxone intravenously or intramuscularly to reverse the effects of opioid agonism.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.",

                        "As with other opiate-based painkillers, the chronic use of hydrocodone can be considered moderately addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of hydrocodone develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Hydrocodone presents cross-tolerance with all opioids, meaning that after the consumption of hydrocodone all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\nThe risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and relapse, largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual dosage if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.",

Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2m2b, alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL, methaqualone) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of respiratory depression. These substances potentiate the muscle relaxation, sedation and amnesia caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    Dissociatives - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    Stimulants - It is dangerous to combine hydrocodone, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of hydrocodone, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of hydrocodone will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as other effects.

Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the morphine alkaloid from the latex of the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). Although the name heroin is a traditional trade name for a Bayer Pharmaceutical product containing diacetylmorphine, the name has since been widely adopted for all intents and purposes and may describe a recreational depressant that may or may not contain pure diacetylmorphine.\n\nIn its pure form, heroin is active at doses of 5mg and above; however, the substance is most commonly found in a preparation containing significant impurities. These impurities can result from including processing faults during synthesis, the addition of harmful or benign cutting agents, or the substitution of significantly more potent and dangerous analogous substances such as fentanyl adulterated into the end-product before distribution. This makes accurate dosing is particularly difficult.",

Heroin and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13, with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\nHeroin, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. Heroin contains two acetate (CH3COO−) groups bonded to R3 and R6 of its structure, and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17. On the same ring containing the 6-acetyl group, heroin contains a double bond.\n\nHeroin's chemical structure is closely related to morphine. Heroin is the 3,6-diacetyl derivative of the diol morphine, meaning it contains acetate functional groups at the same locations hydroxy groups are found in morphine (3,6). Heroin is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, codeine, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone.",

                        "Heroin itself is an inactive drug, but it is metabolized into morphine when inserted into the body. When taken orally, heroin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism via deacetylation, making it a prodrug for the systemic delivery of morphine. When the drug is injected, however, it avoids this first-pass effect, very rapidly crossing the blood–brain barrier because of the presence of the acetyl groups which render it much more fat soluble, and thus more potent, than morphine itself.\n\nOnce in the brain, it is deacetylated variously into the inactive 3-monoacetylmorphine and the active 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). 6-MAM is found in some commerically prepared batches of black tar heroin, often found on the west coast of the United States. It is then deacetylated into morphine, which binds to μ-opioid receptors. Heroin itself exhibits relatively low affinity for the μ receptor, suggesting that much of the psychoactive effects of the substance come from the metabolites of heroin rather than the diacetylmorphine itself.\n\nThe recreational effects of this compound, including cognitive euphoria and physical euphoria, occur because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally produced within the body and are also active on the μ-opioid receptor set in the brain. The way in which synthetic opioids such as heroin structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoric, pain relief and anxiolytic effects.

It differs in texture from powder heroin in that it is black, gooey, viscous, and a texture ranging from quite similar to wet asphalt and a hard rock of material. It is commonly produced in South America and is found on the western coast of the USA.\n\nThe actual chemical contents of black tar heroin can vary from the white powder form. Black tar might contain a variable mixture of morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) which is another result of crude acetylation that occurs in the clandestine production process.\n\nWhen injected into any type of tissue, this form of heroin results in an increased risk of wound botulism. Wound botulism can be fatal and leads to amputations and death in a higher rate of black tar heroin users. Because of the consistency of the substance (tar like), it can pose a greater risk for collapsing, damaging, or infecting veins. This damage to veins leads to a higher chance of subcutaneous and intradermal injection which is not advocated from a harm reduction point of view.

                        "Like many other opioids, unadulterated heroin at appropriate dosages does not cause many long-term complications other than physical and psychological dependence and constipation. Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of opioid usage are exclusively associated with not taking the necessary precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure heroin products that contain harmful additives.\n\nHeavy dosages of heroin can result in severe respiratory depression which can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors - this effect is proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed.\n\nDue to the nature of the unregulated drug market, illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. A user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended in the event of obtaining a purer product than they are used to, or may be cut unknowingly with more potent and dangerous substances such as fentanyl. Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours and is a direct result of respiratory depression leading onto anoxia (oxygen deprivation) resulting from the breathing reflex being suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors. Some sources quote the median lethal dose (for an average 75 kg opiate-naive individual) as being between 75 and 600mg.\n\nHeroin can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nIn case of a suspected or known overdose, it is advised to administer a dose of naloxone intravenously, intramuscularly, or nasally to reverse the effects of opioid agonism.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices such as volumetric dosing, when using this substance to ensure the administration of the intended dose (especially due to the unusually high risk of overdose this substance presents.)",

                        "As with other opioids, the chronic use of heroin can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological and physical dependence among certain users. When psychological or physical addiction has developed, mental and physical withdrawal symptoms and cravings may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of heroin develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same psychoactive effects of a previously lower dose. After heroin tolerance has developed, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Heroin presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of heroin all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\nThe risk of fatal heroin overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and relapse, largely because of reduced tolerance. When users dose their old doses, they no longer have the physical tolerance to handle the sedative effects of heroin and overdose occurs. To account for this lack of physical tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual dosage if using after a prolonged period of sobriety. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in tolerance: in one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.\n\nStudies have shown that the subjective cognitive euphoria and physical euphoria of heroin use, which is the reinforcing component of addiction, is proportional in its' intensity to the rate at which the blood level concentrations of the drug increases. Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the fastest. It is followed by smoking, suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing).",

The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, GHB/GBL, methaqualone) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of respiratory depression. These substances potentiate the muscle relaxation, sedation and amnesia caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    Dissociatives - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    Stimulants - It is dangerous to combine heroin, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of heroin, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of heroin will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as other effects. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only taking a certain amount of heroin.",

It is widely used for its analgesic, antitussive, antidiarrheal, anxiolytic, antidepressant, sedative, depressant and hypnotic properties. It is also used to suppress premature labor contractions, myocardial infarction, and has many other potential and indicated uses.\n\nCodeine is the second most predominant alkaloid in opium (up to three percent). Although codeine can be extracted from natural sources, a semi-synthetic process is the primary source of codeine for pharmaceutical use. It is considered the prototype of the weak to midrange opioids (tramadol, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone).\n\nCodeine is currently the most widely used opiate in the world, and is one of the most commonly used drugs overall according to numerous reports by organizations including the World Health Organization and its League of Nations predecessor agency. It is one of the most effective orally administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin.\n\nRecreationally, it is usually purchased over the counter within painkillers that mix it with other more toxic substances. These can be separated using a cold water extraction technique.",

Codeine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan. Codeine (along with other morphinans) contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. It contains a hydroxy group (OH-) bound at R6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17.\n\nOn the same ring containing the hydroxy group, codeine contains a double bond which dihydrocodeine lacks. Codeine is closely related to morphine as both contain an oxygen group at R3, but this oxygen group in codeine is substituted by a methyl group (making a methoxy group). Codeine is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone.",

                        "Codeine is not itself centrally active, and must first be converted via first pass metabolism into morphine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 (as such, it is a prodrug for morphine). Codeine is also metabolised into the inactive norcodeine via the CYP3A4 enzyme system. Both resultant forms are conjugated by UGT2B7 into their corresponding 3-glucuronide.\n\nSome percentage of the population produce less CYP2D6 enzymes and so experience a significant reduction of effects from codeine in comparison to that of the average person. However, others produce CYP2D6 enzymes in higher quantities which can result in a hypersensitivity to the drug.\n\nThere is an upper limit to the amount of codeine which can be converted by enzymatic metabolism into morphine throughout an individual session. This limit is commonly referred to as the \"ceiling dose\", which is commonly believed to be around 400mg. Consuming higher doses will lead to greater side effects such as itchiness and nausea, but will not necessarily increase the euphoria experienced.\n\nSome methods of potentiating opioids, such as using grape fruit juice throughout the day before consumption, rely on disrupting the cytochrome P450 enzymes' ability to metabolize the chemical. Since codeine is a prodrug and relies on enzymatic conversion for activation, these methods will actually inhibit its effectiveness.\n\nThe active metabolites of codeine, notably morphine, exert their effects by binding to and activating opioid receptors, mainly the μ-opioid receptor. This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\nCodeine itself is a weak ligand for the opioid receptors however its main active metabolite - morphine shows much stronger agonistic effects.\nBinding affinities (Ki)\n\n    Mu opioid agonist - 589 nM\n    Kappa opioid agonist - 18061 nM\n    Delta opioid agonist - 11442 nM",

When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of codeine develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL, methaqualone, opioids) - This combination potentiates the muscle relaxation, amnesia, sedation, and respiratory depression caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of vomiting while unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If nausea or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n\n    Stimulants - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with stimulants due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified disinhibition, motor control loss, and dangerous black-out states. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.\n\n    Dissociatives - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the amnesia, sedation, motor control loss and delusions that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of respiratory depression. If nausea or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.",

                        "Tramadol (also known as Ultram, Ralivia or Tramal) is a synthetic opioid analgesic which is commonly prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain. It was first launched and marketed as Tramal by the German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH in West Germany. It would take another 20 years for it to be launched in English-speaking countries such as the UK, US and Australia.\n\nTramadol is a reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin and a weak μ-opioid receptor agonist. Tramadol is metabolised to O-Desmethyltramadol (O-DSMT), a significantly more potent opioid.\n\nTramadol is marketed as a racemic mixture of both R and S stereoisomers. This is because the two isomers compliment each other's analgesic activity. It is often combined with paracetamol as this is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain.\n\nUnlike most opioids, tramadol has been established to lower the seizure threshold in humans. This makes its effects and interactions relatively unpredictable. As a result, high doses or combinations with other psychoactive substances are strongly advised against.",

                        "(+/-)Tramadol, or 2-[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol, is an atypical synthetic opioid. Tramadol is loosely analogous to codeine, but is not a morphinan opiate. Instead, tramadol contains two rings that include a cyclohexane ring bonded to a phenyl ring at R1. This phenyl ring is substituted at R3 with a methoxy group (CH3O-). At the same location (R1) the cyclohexane ring is bonded to the phenyl ring, an additional hydroxy group is found. Tramadol features a second substitution on its cyclohexane ring at R2. Here, the ring is bonded to a dimethylamine group connected through a methyl bridge.\n\nTramadol is unique as it is found in a racemate (combination) of its stereoisomers. These are two molecules that share the same chemical structure, but are three-dimensional mirror images of each other. Tramadol is produced as a racemate of its two isomers because the combination is proven to be more effective. The picture seen above is the R- enantiomer of tramadol, switching the dashed and solid wedges seen on the molecule skeleton results in the S- enantiomer. It is produced as a hydrochloride salt.",

The R- enantiomer is a selective agonist of the mu receptors and inhibits serotonin reuptake while the S- enantiomer inhibits noradrenaline reuptake. Tramadol acts as an opioid receptor agonist, serotonin releasing agent, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, NMDA receptor antagonist, 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, (α7)5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, TRPV1 receptor agonist, and M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist.\n\nThe euphoric effects of this compound stem from the way in which opioids bind to and activate the μ-opioid receptor. This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.",

                        "As with other opioids, the chronic use of tramadol can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of tramadol develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Tramadol presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of tramadol all opioids will have a reduced effect.",

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL, methaqualone, opioids) - This combination potentiates the muscle relaxation, amnesia, sedation, and respiratory depression caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of vomiting while unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If nausea or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n\n    Stimulants - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with stimulants due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified disinhibition, motor control loss, and dangerous black-out states. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.\n\n    Dissociatives - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the amnesia, sedation, motor control loss and delusions that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of respiratory depression. If nausea or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    Psychedelics - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and psychedelics are believed to be potential triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them.\n\nSerotonin syndrome risk\n\nCombinations in the list below may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels.\n\n    MAOIs such as syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants\n    Serotonin releasers such as MDMA, 4-FA, MDAI and αMT\n    Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n    Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n    5-HTP",

Oxycodone and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called a phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13, with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\nOxycodone, along with other morphinans, contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. It contains a carbonyl group bound at R6 and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17. The carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl saturates the benzene ring it is bonded with. Thus oxycodone lacks the double bond on that ring found in codeine. Oxycodone also shares the 3-methoxy substitution found in codeine; however, it contains an additional hydroxy group at R14. Oxycodone is analogous to the other morphinans including dihydrocodeine, heroin, ethylmorphine, and codeine.",

                        "Oxycodone produces effects that are typical of μ-opioid agonists, suggesting a pharmacological similarity to more traditional opioids, such as codeine and morphine. These compounds exert their effects by binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptor. This occurs because opioids structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the μ-opioid receptor set. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoria, pain relief and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\n\nIn 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the κ-opioid receptor appears to be involved in the direct pain relief caused by oxycodone, while in nondiabetic mice, the μ1-opioid receptor seems to be primarily responsible for these effects.",

                        "As with other opioids, the chronic use of oxycodone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of oxycodone develops with prolonged and repeated use. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Oxycodone presents cross-tolerance with all other opioids, meaning that after the consumption of oxycodone all opioids will have a reduced effect.\n\nThe risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and relapse, largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual dosage if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.",

The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL, methaqualone, opioids) - This combination potentiates the muscle relaxation, amnesia, sedation, and respiratory depression caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of vomiting while unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If nausea or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n\n    Stimulants - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with stimulants due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified disinhibition, motor control loss, and dangerous black-out states. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.\n\n    Dissociatives - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the amnesia, sedation, motor control loss and delusions that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of respiratory depression. If nausea or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.",

                        "Morphine is a naturally-occurring opioid analgesic found in the alkaloids of the latex of the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). As with other opioids, it is used as both a pain relief medication and as a recreational substance for the relaxation, anxyiolysis and intense states of physical and cognitive euphoria it can induce. Potentially serious side effects include a decreased respiratory effort and dangerously low blood pressure, which can be fatal mixed with other depressants. If the dose is reduced after long-term use withdrawal may occur. Common side effects of this include drowsiness, vomiting, and constipation. The frequent and regular administration of morphine is associated with escalating tolerance, physical dependence and addiction.\n\nMorphine can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally. It reaches its maximum effect is around 20 min when given intravenously and 60 min when given orally while the duration of effect is between three and seven hours. Long-acting formulations also exist.\n\nThe primary source of morphine is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy. In 2013 an estimated 523,000 kilograms of morphine were produced. About 45,000 kilograms were used directly for pain, an increase over the last twenty years of four times. Most use for this purpose was in the developed world. About 70% of morphine is used to make other opioids such as hydromorphone, oxycodone and heroin.",

Morphine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R9 and R13 with the nitrogen member looking at R17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.\n\nMorphine (along with other morphinans) contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R4 and R5 through an oxygen group. It contains two hydroxy groups (OH-), bound at R6 and R3, and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R17.\n\nMorphine is a precursor for many morphinan drugs, it is used to synthesize codeine through methylation of its R3 hydroxy group, and heroin through acetylation. Other closely related opioids include hydrocodone, oxycodone, and dihydrocodeine. The chemical structure of morphine is the basis of hundreds of opioid derivatives with a wide range of effects.",

Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (pain reduction), sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure and enjoyment. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.\n\nThese appear to stem from the way in which opioids mimic endogenous endorphins.

                        "As with other opiate-based painkillers, the chronic use of morphine can be considered extremely addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, withdrawal symptoms may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of morphine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly.\n\nThe risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and relapse, largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual dosage if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.",

Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence, the harmful or toxic aspects of morphine usage are exclusively associated with not taking appropriate precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure products.\n\nHeavy dosages of morphine can result in respiratory depression, leading onto fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by agonism of µ-opioid receptors proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nMorphine can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the recovery position).\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.",

It has also been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic to treat conditions such as insomnia, clinical depression, and alcoholism, and to improve athletic performance.\n\nIt is used as a recreational drug for its alcohol-like effects. While a common recreational dose is 3g, a dose of 5g - 10g can result in convulsions, unconsciousness (a coma-like state) and vomiting. Doses above 10g+ are associated with a risk of death. It is important to start with a low dose and work your way up slowly by increasing the dosage in small increments.\n\nGHB, and sometimes GBL have acquired a reputation as \"date rape drugs,\" in which they are purportedly secretly put dropwise into drinks.

                        "GHB has at least two distinct binding sites in the central nervous system. GHB is an agonist at the newly characterized GHB receptor, which is excitatory. It is also a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor, which is inhibitory.\n\nGHB induces the accumulation of either a derivative of tryptophan or tryptophan itself, possibly by increasing tryptophan transport across the blood–brain barrier. GHB-induced stimulation may be due to this increase in tryptophan transport to the brain and in its uptake by serotonergic cells. As the serotonergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep, mood, and anxiety, the stimulation of this system by high doses of GHB may be involved in certain neuropharmacological events induced by GHB administration.\n\nHowever, at therapeutic doses, GHB reaches much higher concentrations in the brain and activates GABAB receptors, which are primarily responsible for its sedative effects. GHB's sedative effects are blocked by GABAB antagonists. As the GABA system is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the sedating (or calming effects) of GHB on the nervous system.\n\nThere has been somewhat limited research into the GHB receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Drugs that selectively activate the GHB receptor cause absence seizures in high doses, as do GHB and GABAB agonists.\n\nActivation of both the GHB receptor and GABAB is responsible for the addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. This means that while low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor, higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABAB receptors. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor.\n\nThis explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB as well as the so-called \"rebound\" effect experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB-induced deep sleep. Over time, the concentration of GHB in the system decreases below the threshold for significant GABAB receptor activation and activates predominantly the GHB receptor, leading to wakefulness.",

                        "GHB is considered to be a safe and non-toxic substance when used responsibly or medically. The LD50 is above the active dosage, and there is no danger of acute toxicity. However, it can be dangerous when used as a recreational drug or abused. There have been many negative reports from recreational users who have overdosed, combined GHB with alcohol or other drugs, or accidentally dosed themselves unexpectedly.\n\nOne publication has investigated 226 deaths attributed to GHB. Seventy-one deaths (34%) were caused by GHB alone while the other deaths were from respiratory depression caused by interaction with alcohol or other drugs.\n\nTo avoid a possible overdose of GHB, it is important to start with a low dose and work your way up slowly by increasing the dosage in small increments. While a common recreational dose is 3g, a dose of 5g - 10g can result in convulsions, unconsciousness and vomiting. Doses above 10g+ are associated with a risk of death. One must also factor in the added difficulty of knowing the purity of the product (among other problems like its hygroscopy may lower the concentration of GHB in one solution, which is the form which is commonly bought and sold in the illicit market). This makes it hard for even the experienced user to dose properly.\n\nAccidental ingestions of GHB have also occurred due to inadequate storage methods. If GHB is put into a clear liquid, glass, or bottle, it can be easily mistaken for water. It is recommended to clearly label your GHB in writing and dye the liquid with blue food coloring so it no longer resembles a drinkable beverage. It is also recommended to store your GHB in a container that no one would drink out of.\n\nAs an endogenous regulator of energy metabolism and a natural neurotransmitter, GHB is well-known to the brain and organs which are used to its effects and have highly efficient systems for metabolizing it safely. The substance is eliminated (that is, back to baseline levels) in 2-4 hours and continues to be so even after twice-daily doses for a week. In one European study, no adverse effects were reported after several years of regular recreational use.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this drug.",

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n        A review of the details of 194 deaths attributed to or related to GHB over a ten-year period found that most were from respiratory depression caused by interaction with alcohol or other drugs. In humans, GHB has been shown to inhibit the elimination rate of alcohol. This may explain the respiratory arrest that has been reported after ingestion of both drugs. These substances potentiate the muscle relaxation, sedation and amnesia caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL, methaqualone, opioids) - This combination potentiates the muscle relaxation, amnesia, sedation, and respiratory depression caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of vomiting while unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If nausea or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n\n    Stimulants - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with stimulants due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified disinhibition, motor control loss, and dangerous black-out states. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.\n\n    Dissociatives - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the amnesia, sedation, motor control loss and delusions that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of respiratory depression. If nausea or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.",

It is historically one of the oldest and most widely used psychoactive substances and continues to be the most widely used recreational substance to this day.\n\nAn alcoholic beverage is a drink that typically contains 3%–60% ethanol, commonly known as alcohol. Alcoholic beverages are divided into three classes: beers, wines, and spirits (distilled beverages). They are legally consumed in most countries around the world. More than 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption.\n\nAlcoholic beverages have been produced and consumed by humans since the Neolithic Era, from hunter-gatherer communities to nation-states.\n\nAlcoholic beverages have a different taste depending on their contents and brewing ingredients.",

However, molecular pharmacology studies have shown that alcohol has only a few primary targets. These effects are facilitatory in some systems and inhibitory in others.\n\nAmong the neurotransmitter systems with enhanced functions are:\n\n    GABA: In a fashion similar to benzodiazepines, an enhancement of the inhibitory system known as GABA induces neurological inhibition. This depresses the behavioral inhibitory centers, slows down the processing of information from the senses, inhibits thought processes and generally induces a suppression of both normal physical and cognitive functioning.\n    5-HT3 receptor agonism\n    Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\n\nAmong those that are inhibited are:\n\n    Glutamate: By making this excitatory neurotransmitter less effective, neurological functioning is further inhibited. Alcohol does this by interacting with the receptors on the receiving cells in these pathways and blocking glutamate from binding to NMDA receptors and triggering electrochemical signals.\n    Dihydropyridine\n\nThe result of these direct effects is a wave of further indirect effects involving a variety of other neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems, leading finally to the behavioural or symptomatic effects of alcohol intoxication. It's worth noting, however, that in terms of how these processes directly result in the subjective experience of ethanol intoxication, the exact mechanisms are still largely unknown beyond speculation.",

When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of alcohol develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Alcohol presents cross-tolerance with all GABAgenic depressants, meaning that after the consumption of alcohol all depressants will have a reduced effect.\n\nChronic excess alcohol intake, or alcohol dependence, can lead to a wide range of neuropsychiatric or neurological impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and malignant neoplasms. The psychiatric disorders which are associated with alcoholism include major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, neurologic deficits (e.g., impairments of working memory, emotions, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, gait and balance) and brain damage. Alcohol dependence is associated with hypertension, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and also cancers of the respiratory system, the digestive system, liver, breast and ovaries.

To be classified as alcohol withdrawal syndrome, patients must exhibit at least two of the following symptoms: increased hand tremors, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transient hallucinations (auditory, visual or tactile), psychomotor agitation, anxiety, tonic-clonic seizures, and autonomic instability.\n\nThe severity of symptoms is dictated by a number of factors, the most important of which is degree of alcohol intake, length of time the individual has been using alcohol, and previous history of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms are also grouped together and classified:\n\n    Alcohol hallucinosis: Patients have transient visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations but are otherwise clear.\n    Withdrawal seizures: Seizures occur within 48 hours of alcohol cessation and occur either as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure or as a brief episode of multiple seizures.\n    Delirium tremens: Hyperadrenergic state, disorientation, tremors, diaphoresis, impaired attention/consciousness, and visual and auditory hallucinations usually occur 24 to 72 hours after alcohol cessation.

The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Depressants (1,4-Butanediol, 2M2B, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB/GBL, methaqualone, opioids) - This combination potentiates the muscle relaxation, amnesia, sedation, and respiratory depression caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of vomiting while unconsciousness and dying from the resulting suffocation. If nausea or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n\n    Stimulants - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with stimulants due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the sedative effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified disinhibition, motor control loss, and dangerous black-out states. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.\n\n    Dissociatives - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the amnesia, sedation, motor control loss and delusions that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of respiratory depression. If nausea or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the recovery position or have a friend move them into it.\n    MAOIs - This combination can result in dangerous reactions through the way in which tyramine, a chemical commonly found in alcoholic beverages, causes increased blood pressure.",

It is structurally similar to cocaine and has stimulant and anorectic properties, although is notably absent of cocaine's anesthetic effects.\n\nDichloropane has been shown to have a slower onset and longer duration of action compared to cocaine in animal studies.\n\nDichloropane first appeared in late 2016. It is thought to be the first cocaine analog to be made available (in limited quantities) on the online research chemical market. It is also the only batch of a purported cocaine analog to be independently verified by third-party lab analysis.\n\nThis is significant because it marks a marked evolution in the synthetic production capacities of the web-based research chemical market. It had up until that point been considered a non-viable compound to produce, due to the difficulty and expense of its synthesis.\n\nExtremely little is known about the pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicity of dichloropane in humans. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if choosing to use this substance.",

This substance acts as a triple reuptake inhibitor and prevents monoamine neurotransmitters from being recycled, causing excessive amounts to build up in the synapse, or junction between neurons. The result is an enhanced and prolonged post-synaptic effect of monoaminergic signaling at receptors on the receiving neuron. It is this sudden flood of neurotransmitters in the synapses of various brain regions that is thought to cause dichloropane's effects.\n\nNotably, dichloropane has a higher relative affinity for the serotonin transporter over the dopamine transporter than cocaine, which is in part suspected to be responsible for the differences in its subjective effects.",

                        "The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational dichloropane use has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because dichloropane has very little history of human usage. In terms of neurotoxicity (as defined by the damage or death of cells in the brain in response to over-excitation or reactive oxidation caused by drugs), it is reasonable to assume that like other stimulants which work principally through reuptake inhibition (e.g. cocaine), dichloropane should not exhibit these effects unlike certain other substances such as methamphetamine, which have suspected mechanisms of direct neurotoxicity. The extended use or abuse of dichloropane, however, is likely to cause both short and down-term down regulation of the receptors of the major neurotransmitter (monoamine) systems it interacts with. However, this still remains a subject of active inquiry.\n\nDue to its structural similarity to cocaine, it is worth noting that the most potentially harmful physical effects of dichloropane could not be neurological but cardiovascular. For example, severe cardiac adverse events, particularly sudden cardiac death, become a serious risk at high doses for cocaine due to cocaine's blocking effect on cardiac sodium channels, and it is possible that dichloropane may share this risk despite not having topical anesthetic activity. Moreover, long-term cocaine usage may result in Cocaine-Related Cardiomyopathy.  It is as of yet unknown whether dichloropane presents similar risks, but it is reasonable to assume that it might, and thus should be approached with additional caution.\n\nIt is suspected that regular dichloropane insufflation can have extremely adverse effects on one's nostrils, nose and nasal cavities. These include a loss of the sense of smell, nosebleeds, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or a chronically runny nose.\n\nAnecdotal evidence from people who have tried dichloropane within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).\n\nIt is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices when using this substance.",

When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of dichloropane develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 2 - 4 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 1.5 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Dichloropane likely presents cross-tolerance with all dopaminergic stimulants, meaning that after the consumption of cocaine all stimulants will have a reduced effect.",

                        "Although many psychoactive substances are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. Independent research should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.\n\n    Stimulants - When used in conjunction with other stimulants, the cardiovascular effects of cocaine such as increased heart rate become dangerously high. This is potentially fatal and severely increases the risk of cardiac arrest.\n    Depressants - When used in conjunction with depressants such as opioids and benzodiazepines, the cardiovascular effects of the two classes begin to conflict as one increases the heart rate while the other decreases it. This is potentially fatal and can result in an extremely irregular heart rate leading onto cardiac arrest.\n    Depressants - It is dangerous to combine alcohol, a depressant, with stimulants due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the sedative effect of alcohol which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of alcohol will be significantly increased, leading to intensified disinhibition as well as respiratory depression. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.\n    MDMA - The neurotoxic and potential cardiotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with dichloropane.\n    MAOIs - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include syrian rue, banisteriopsis caapi, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, αMT, and some antidepressants.\n    Nicotine - Some dichloropane users find that consumption of tobacco products during dichloropane use enhances the euphoria because nicotine increases the levels of dopamine in the brain. This, however, may have undesirable consequences such as uncontrollable chain smoking during dichloropane use, in addition to the detrimental health effects and the additional strain on the cardiovascular system caused by tobacco.",

                        "<p>\"The rowdy onion joins the aristocratic shallot, the gentle leek, the \nherbaceous chive, sharp scallion and assertive garlic among the 500 \nspecies of the genus Allium. Allium cepa is an ancient vegetable, known \nto Alexander the Great and eaten by the Israelites during their Egyptian\n bondage. Indeed, his charges chastened Moses for leading them away from\n the onions and other flavorful foods that they had come to relish while\n in captivity. And with good reason: onion is a rich source of \nnutrients, including vitamins B, C and G, protein, starch and a series \nof essential elements. The chemicals contained in onions are reported to\n be effective agents against fungal and bacterial growth; they protect \nagainst stomach, colon and skin cancers; they have anti-inflammatory, \nantiallergenic, antiasthmatic and antidiabetic actions; and they treat \ncauses of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, \nhyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia while also inhibiting platelet \naggregation.\n</p><p>\"The price of this goodness is tears. The volatile oils that help to give Allium vegetables their distinctive flavors contain a class of organic molecules known as amino acid sulfoxides. Peeling, cutting or crushing an onion's tissue releases enzymes called allinases, which convert these molecules to sulfenic acids. The sulfenic acids, in turn, spontaneously rearrange to form syn-propanethial-S-oxide, the chemical that triggers the tears. They also condense to form odorous thiosulfinates, coincidentally evoking the pungent odor associated with chopping onions and eliciting the false accusation that it is the odor that causes the weepy eye. Incidentally, sulfenic acid in garlic takes a different chemical route, sparing the eyes. The formation of syn-propanethial-S-oxide peaks at about 30 seconds after mechanical damage to the onion and completes its cycle of chemical evolution over about five minutes.</p><p>\n\"Its effects on the eye are all too familiar. The front surface of the \neye--the cornea--serves several purposes, among them protection against \nphysical and chemical irritants. The cornea is densely populated with \nsensory fibers of the ciliary nerve, a branch of the massive trigeminal \nnerve that brings touch, temperature and pain sensations from the face \nand front of the head. The cornea also receives a smaller number of \nautonomic motor fibers that activate the lachrymal (tear) glands. Free \nnerve endings detect syn-propanethial-S-oxide on the cornea and drive \nactivity in the ciliary nerve--which the central nervous system \ninterprets as a burning sensation--in proportion to the compound's \nconcentration. This nerve activity reflexively activates the autonomic \nfibers, which then carry a signal back to the eye ordering the lachrymal\n glands to wash the irritant away.\n</p><p>\n\"There are several solutions to the problem of onion tears. You can heat\n onions before chopping to denature the enzymes. You might also try ways\n to limit contact with the vapors: chop onions on a breezy porch, under a\n steady stream of water or mechanically in a closed container. But do \nnot forgo the sensory pleasure and healthful effects of Allium cepa.\"</p>",

In the second form, BRAO and hearing\n loss are the main problems, and there is little or no brain disease. In\n the third form, encephalopathy is the main problem in the beginning, \nbut recurrent episodes of BRAO and hearing loss become the main problem \nafter the encephalopathy goes away.\n\nThe encephalopathic form of Susac's syndrome often resolves \nspontaneously (often going away within 1-3 years). The other forms tend \nto follow a more prolonged, more chronic course (3-10 years, or \nmore).&nbsp;All forms require immunosuppressive treatment while the disease \nis active.\n\nIntroduction\nAlthough considered rare, Susac's syndrome is being recognized more \noften worldwide and its true frequency in the general population is \nunknown. This is because the disorder may be misdiagnosed, often as \n“atypical” multiple sclerosis.\n\nSusac's syndrome is an autoimmune disease---specifically, an autoimmune \nendotheliopathy. \"Autoimmune\" means that a person’s own immune system is\n mistakenly attacking one's own healthy tissue. An \"endotheliopathy\" is \nany disorder that involves injury to the endothelium, which is the thin \nlayer of cells that line the inner walls of blood vessels. In Susac's \nsyndrome, the person's own immune system is mistakenly attacking the \nendothelial lining of the smallest blood vessels (the capillaries, \nvenules and arterioles) in the brain, retina, and inner ear. When the \nendothelial cells become injured, they tend to swell, and this \nendothelial cell swelling plays a key role in the partial or complete \nocclusion (blockage) of the tiny vessels in the brain, retina and inner \near. This blockage results in decreased blood flow through the vessels \nand, therefore, decreased delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain,\n retina, and inner ear---causing these three organs to suffer. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;",

Miga thinks it’s 8 percent.</p>\n<p>The reason for these gaps&nbsp;is that DNA sequencing machines don’t read \ngenomes like humans read books, from the first word to the last. \nInstead, they first randomly chop up copies of the 23 pairs of \nchromosomes, which total some 3 billion “letters,” so the machines \naren’t overwhelmed. The resulting chunks contain from 1,000 letters \n(during the Human Genome Project) to a few hundred (in today’s more \nadvanced sequencing machines). The chunks overlap. Computers&nbsp;match up \nthe overlaps, assembling the chunks into the correct sequence.</p>\n<p>That’s between difficult and impossible to do if the chunks contain \nlots of repetitive segments, such as TTAATATTAATATTAATA, or TTAATA three\n times. “The problem is, when you have the same exact words, it’s hard \nto assemble,” said Lander, just as if jigsaw puzzle pieces show the same\n exact blue sky.</p>\n<p>In 2004, the genome project reported&nbsp;that\n there were 341 gaps in the sequence. Most of the gaps — 250 — are in \nthe main part of each chromosome, where genes make the proteins that \nlife runs on. These gaps are tiny. Only a&nbsp;few gaps — 33 at last count — \nlie in or near each chromosome’s centromere (where the two parts of a \nchromosome connect) and telomeres (the caps at the end of chromosomes), \nbut these 33 are 10 times as long in total&nbsp;as the 250 gaps.</p>\n<p>That makes the centromeres in particular the genome’s uncharted Zambezi. Evan Eichler of the University of Washington<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said\n every chromosome has such sequence-defying repetitive elements — think \nof them as DNA stutters — including an infamous one that’s 171 letters \nlong and repeated end-to-end for thousands of letters.</p>",

                "<h4>1. Try Ice</h4>\n<p>Applying ice on the swollen areas of your tongue will relieve the \nswelling. You can use ice cubes to soothe your tongue but you must be \ncareful not to burn it. They can burn your tongue if you keep them on \nyour tongue for long.</p>\n<h4>2. Get Hydrated</h4>\n<p>Dehydration and a dry mouth will cause sore and swollen taste buds. \nTake lots of fluids everyday to hydrate your tongue and reduce the \nirritation. Alternatively take probiotic yogurts for a fast relief from \nirritated taste receptors.</p>\n<h4>3. Use Baking Soda</h4>\n<p>The anti-inflammatory properties in baking soda make it an effective \nremedy to inflamed taste buds. You can apply baking soda on the affected\n areas and leave it there to reduce the swelling and irritation. Baking \nsoda removes the gastric acid in your mouth from regurgitated food, \nwhich causes sore taste buds.</p>\n<h4>4. Gargle with Salt Water</h4>\n<p>Add one teaspoon of salt to lukewarm water until it dissolves to form\n a salt solution. Gargle your mouth with this solution to relieve the \nswollen areas. To treat a swollen taste bud on tip of tongue, gargle the\n solution at least three times every day. This will also relieve swollen\n buds at the back of your tongue.</p>\n<h4>5. Rinse with Tea Tree Oil</h4>\n<p>Tea tree oil can relieve swollen tongue. Mix a few drops of this \nnatural oil with warm water and gargle your mouth with the mixture. This\n solution is very effective in reducing swelling that is caused by \nbacteria in the mouth. Be careful with this remedy because excess tea \ntree oil may cause hallucinations.</p>\n<h4>6. Apply Honey</h4>\n<p>Honey is the best home remedy for swollen taste buds because it has \nhealing and anti-bacterial properties. You can swash honey in your mouth\n or tongue to relieve swelling. You can also make a warm honey solution \nand gargle it several times in your mouth.</p>\n<h4>7. Pepper, Ginger and Garlic</h4>\n<p>Use the three ingredients to make a solution and take it at least \nfour times in a day. This solution is very effective when bacteria cause\n a swollen taste bud on tip of tongue.</p>\n<h4>8. Glycerin</h4>\n<p>If your taste buds swell because of mouth sores or physical injuries,\n apply glycerin on the affected areas. Glycerin heals an inflamed tongue\n and taste receptors.</p>\n<h4>9. Try Medical Treatments</h4>\n<p>Doctors will prescribe different medical treatment for swollen buds \ndepending on their cause. Hence, you will get different treatments for \nswelling caused by trauma, STDs, viral infections, and bacteria. In case\n of nutritional deficiency, doctors recommend Vitamin C and B complex. \nIn case of bacterial infections and HPV herpes, doctors prescribe \nantivirals and antibiotics. Fungal medications treat any yeast \ninfections.</p>",

Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \"angiosperm\" comes from the Greek composite word (angeion, \"case\" or \"casing\", and sperma, \"seed\") meaning \"enclosed seeds\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.<div><br /></div><div>The ancestors of flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms in the Triassic Period, during the range 245 to 202 million years ago (mya), and the first flowering plants are known from 160 mya. They diversified extensively during the Lower Cretaceous, became widespread by 120 mya, and replaced conifers as the dominant trees from 100 to 60 mya.</div>",

                "The gymnosperms are a group of seed-producing plants (spermatophytes) that includes conifers (Pinophyta), cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes. The term \"gymnosperm\" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, \"naked\" and σπέρμα sperma, \"seed\"), meaning \"naked seeds\". The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in Yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.\n\nThe gymnosperms and angiosperms together compose the spermatophytes or seed plants.<div><br /></div><div>The gymnosperms are divided into six phyla. Organisms that belong to the Cycadophyta, Ginkgophyta, Gnetophyta, and Pinophyta (also known as Coniferophyta) phyla are still in existence while those in the Pteridospermales and Cordaitales phyla are now extinct.\n\nBy far the largest group of living gymnosperms are the conifers (pines, cypresses, and relatives), followed by cycads, gnetophytes (Gnetum, Ephedra and Welwitschia), and Ginkgo biloba (a single living species). Roots in some genera have fungal association with roots in the form of micorrhiza (Pinus), while in some others (Cycas) small specialised roots called coralloid roots are associated with nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class=\"mw-mmv-image\"><img src=\"1024px-Gymnospermae.jpg\" width=\"993\" /></div></div>",
